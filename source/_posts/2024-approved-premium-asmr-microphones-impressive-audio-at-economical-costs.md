Besides the aforementioned factor, here are other things you need to put in place for you to create good ASMR video content:

* **All kind of triggers or unique triggers for your target audience \[listeners\]**

As we all know, ASMR content is designed to provide listeners with that relaxing sensation. Achieving that isn't quite easy as you need to trigger the sensation. However, to help you out, here are some infamous tingling sensations you could employ:

1. Blowing sounds
2. Gentle whispering
3. Scratching
4. Tapping
5. Crinkling
6. Humming
7. Typing
8. Buzzing
9. Chewing
10. Water drops

* **An absolute quiet recording environment**

When creating an ASMR clip, you need perfect decorum for you to achieve your aim. If your environment doesn't support such, then you need top-quality sound editing software that detects and deletes background noise without data loss. Which software supports such services? Find out below.
