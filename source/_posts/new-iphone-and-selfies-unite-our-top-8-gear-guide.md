## Types of Selfie Sticks

By the classification of usage, we could divide selfie stick into 2 kinds.

### 1\. Blue-tooth Connected Selfie Stick

What is a bluetooth selfie stick? It is basically a device controlled by the Bluetooth connected remote control. How is the selfie stick paired with the blue tooth device? It is definitely a better and convenient, but, a bit pricier idea to use the bluetooth selfie stick. The bluetooth can be paired as simply as connecting bluetooth to other devices. Find the bluetooth setting on your iPhone after pressing a button on the stick. When pairing is done, open the camera app and place your iPhone at the end of the stick to click your desired pictures by pressing the remote control.
