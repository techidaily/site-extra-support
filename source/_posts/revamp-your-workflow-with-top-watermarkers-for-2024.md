This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes.

**Conclusion**

There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.

The Visual Watermark software makes watermarking hundreds of photos in a short period of time look easy. Besides watermarking photos, you can also use the Visual Watermark application to add watermarks to videos. There are 260 fonts available, but you can also import your own custom-made fonts and use them to create watermarks. The software adjusts the size and the position of the watermark to each photo automatically, but you can also fine-tune each of these settings manually. Most importantly, the Visual Watermark software protects your images from artificial intelligence algorithms that remove watermarks from photos automatically by making minor changes to the template you’re applying to the photos you’re processing.

#### 10. [Water Marquee](https://www.watermarquee.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images. The process of adding a watermark to a photo with Water Marquee is remarkably simple, as you just have to upload a photo to the platform and click on the Add Text, Add Logo or Use Template option. You can then proceed to insert the text, select its size, color or font and decide if you want to use a solid or transparent background. When done, simply click on the Save icon and choose the destination folder on your hard drive in which the watermarked photo is going to be stored.

**Conclusion**

There is no way to control what happens to the photos you share on your website or on your social media accounts because people can share, repost or download them with a single click. The best way to reduce the chances of unsanctioned use of your work is to watermark all the pictures you share online. Which photo watermarking software do you use to copyright your photos?

This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes.
