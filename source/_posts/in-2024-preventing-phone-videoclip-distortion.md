### 4\. CapCut

CapCut is currently amongst popular video editing applications for iPhone and Android. And, while it was developed by the same firm that created TikTok, it is significantly more than simply a TikTok video editor.

In truth, CapCut's video editing software is robust. You can quickly produce videos for any network with your iPhone. It comes with a fantastic stabilizing tool that allows you to reduce shakiness from your iPhone footage promptly.

### **How to Stabilize a Video Using CapCut?**

Follow the steps below to stabilize a video using CapCut:

**Step 1:** Open CapCut and click on **New Project** to import the video you wish to stabilize.

**Step 2:** Slide down the bottom menu until you find **Stabilize,** and click on it.

**Step 3:** Move the slider that appears to the right to define stabilization strength. After that, click on the **Tick** button in the left corner.

**Step 4:** Now, click on **Download** and then S**ave Video** to export it.

## Part 4: Tips for Shooting Stable Videos with iPhone

The first step to capturing a stabilized video is to understand what your phone is capable of and how to deal with it while capturing smartphone films. As long as you apply the following criteria, your smartphone should react to realistic hand movements:

**Grip Properly**

If you can mount your iPhone to a tripod, then great. However, if it's not possible, you need to firmly hold your phone in your hand and stay still to capture a stabilized video. By keeping the phone firmly in your hand, you can avoid all the shakiness that will result in stabilization.

**Trigger Remotely**

One more step to avoid the shakiness is starting the video with remote triggers. It's better to start the video with your Headphone's volume button because, in that way, you won't need to touch the screen that can destabilize your video.

**Favor the Volume Button**

Another helpful thing for capturing a stabilized video is to favor your phone's Volume Buttons. iPhone allows the user to capture the video as long as they hold the Volume and Power buttons. S, capture the video with the help of Volume Buttons.

**Conclusion**

So, those are some of the methods to **stabilize iPhone video**. You have a variety of alternatives depending on how far you are ready to go to get that steady shot. You may also utilize a mix of the approaches mentioned above and technologies to create an expert vlog, podcast, instructive video, and more.
