## Radiant Contrast Synchronizer

_Before you start working on any video editing, you need to have a good overall understanding of working with color in video. To guide you through the process, we'll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage._

Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don't have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we're here to help point you in the right direction.

## Part 1\. What is color correction?

Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it's about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.

An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.

Whether it's bad lighting or incorrect camera settings, there are plenty of external factors that can affect your videography and ruin your recordings. If the colors in your video don't look right, don't panic because you can quickly fix the problem with a video color correction app on your Android or iPhone device.

To help you choose, we've compiled a shortlist of the 5 best video color correction apps for your smartphone below.

Try FiLMiC Pro if you're a professional and want to edit your videos while you're on the go. Using its robust capabilities that let you make, edit, and correct videos with your smartphone, this software has produced a number of Grammy-winning music videos and documentaries.

With support for log gamma curves, FiLMiC Pro allows you to directly record your video clips, creating ambient (and realistic) ones. You can alter the video saturation, white balance, contrast, and brightness settings while shooting thanks to FiLMiC Pro's full-color grade customization.

It can produce videos for any environment with 4K capability. Frame rates can be changed, additional effects (such as slow motion) can be added, video stabilization can be turned on, and more. Most of the functionality is free, however, some color correcting settings (such as gamma curve controls) demand a paid upgrade.

FiLMiC Pro may be a challenging option for novices due to a challenging learning curve. However, it provides all the functions professionals might possibly require without the need to upgrade to a professional camera system.

* Supports a wide range of frame rates, bit rates, and aspect ratios.
* Support for third-party hardware.
