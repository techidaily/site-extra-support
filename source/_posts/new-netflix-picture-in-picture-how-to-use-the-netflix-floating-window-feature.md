## Part 1\. How to Enable Picture-in-Picture on Netflix on Desktop

### PiP on Mac

1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.
