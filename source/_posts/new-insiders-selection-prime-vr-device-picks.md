Move controllers provide better controls in VR gaming. Virtual reality is unambiguously better with the use of motion controllers with the hands in VR gaming, that is the reason why the HTC Vive is better in tech than the Oculus Rift right now.

## What is VR controller?

Move controllers provide better controls in VR gaming. Virtual reality is unambiguously better with the use of motion controllers with the hands in VR gaming, that is the reason why the HTC Vive is better in tech than the Oculus Rift right now. It is actually a good thing for the PlayStation VR users, formerly, that Sony 460 VR already featured a motion control platform in their PlayStation Move. So, the use of controllers with VR headsets and other peripherals is giving this technology a new life.

### 7\. Amazon Fire TV controller

The Amazon Fire TV Controller is compatible with the Gear VR and it is now the controller we use at RiftyBusiness. At $40 it is not the inexpensive controller but works very good with all applications and is a good Bluetooth device overall. Regrettably, its deficiencies a phone base and it does not fit within the Gear case is also a bit of challenge. Amazon fire TV controller is recommended over the other controllers like this in the market.

### 8\. IPEGA Wireless Controller

It is a very small $20 iPega Wireless Controller and is compatible well with the Gear VR box. This device has four dissimilar combination modes and works fine under the “X” mode. The gadget is small and will not feel too fine in the big hands of a person however it is portable. It can simply fit within the Gear VR’s case which carries it and also has a phone base which is compatible with 5.5 inches’ screen phone devices (which might be very small for the device like Note 4).
