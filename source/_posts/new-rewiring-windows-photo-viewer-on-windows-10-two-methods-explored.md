Though, Windows 10 Photos offers a dark theme, the effectiveness, responsiveness and features available with Windows Photo Viewer are hard to compromise.

## Method 1 to restore Windows Photo Viewer

The first method speaks about, when you have upgraded from a Windows 7/8/8.1 computer to Windows 10\. You can easily swing back to your most loved Windows Photo Viewer within no time. Here is the detailed guide –

**Step 1**: Go to ‘Settings’ and open ‘Apps’. Click on ‘Default Apps’ and check ‘Photo Viewer’. The default photo viewer will be visible here.

**Step 2**: Click on the present photo viewer app over there and look for ‘Windows Photo Viewer’. We assume that you have upgraded from an older version on Windows and Windows Photo Viewer is there in the options.

**Step 3**: Tap on ‘Windows Photo Viewer’ and then exit ‘Settings’. Now, you have successfully restored Windows Photo Viewer and you can open photos in Windows Photo Viewer.

## Method 2 to get Windows Photo Viewer back

Here comes another way to restore Windows Photo Viewer on your computer. If your computer has been upgraded to Windows 10 from an older version, then Windows Photo Viewer might be lying around somewhere. You can retrieve it to view images.

Here is the detailed guide –

**Step 1** – Go to the image or picture folder on your Windows 10 computer and right click on any image. Now, choose ‘Open With’ and click on ‘Choose another app’.

**Step 2** – Tap the ‘More apps’ option here in case, you can’t find out the Windows Photo Viewer within the list.

**Step 3** – Keep scrolling towards the bottom of the screen to find out ‘Windows Photo Viewer’. If ‘Windows Photo Viewer’ is visible, then it has been installed there and you can use it without any problem.

**Note**: If the Windows Photo Viewer isn't there, here is a backup. You need to change Windows Registry to make Windows Photo Viewer returned. You need to go to [Edwin over on Ten Forums](https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/8930-windows-photo-viewer-gone-2.html#post290818) to add code on your PC.
