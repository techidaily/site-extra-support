## How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator

Now that you know what you're getting into, let's finally reveal the entire process. Just follow the steps and do as you see here.

Step1 Open the program and start a new project.

Step2 Click on the **Type tool** and click anywhere on your blank canvas. Then, type in your text—type in anything you want.

![change font illustrator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-font.png)

Step4 Next, choose any color you want for your text from the panel on the screen's left side. Just remember to click on your text first before you start changing colors.

![change color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-color.png)

Step5 Align the text to make it easier to edit and move around the canvas later. Just click on it and then click on the three buttons in the image below. This section is located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
