Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.

Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.

##### Step1 Apply Transition between the clips

Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window > Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.

## Part 2 Fade In/Out sound on Premiere Pro

Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.

Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.

![types of crossfade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg)

You can find these options in Effects > Audio Transitions > Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.

### Constant Gain

The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.

![constant gain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg)

But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.

### Constant Power

Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.

![constant power](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg)

Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.

### Exponential Fade

Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.

## Part 2 Fade In/Out sound on Premiere Pro

Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.

Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.

![types of crossfade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg)

You can find these options in Effects > Audio Transitions > Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.

### Constant Gain

The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![constant gain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg)

But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.

### Constant Power

Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![constant power](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg)

Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Exponential Fade

Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.
