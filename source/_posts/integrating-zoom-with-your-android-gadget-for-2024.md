## Integrating Zoom with Your Android Gadget

Since working from home has become a trend for a majority of people now, the trend of online/virtual/zoom meetings has also skyrocketed. People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets. It doesn't matter if you have a laptop or a smartphone you can put Zoom to use anytime.

So if you have a query, "is Zoom in android actually a thing?" and if you are new to Zoom, don't know how to start or join a Zoom meeting on Android, and how to schedule it, this step-wise process will help you out. So before making that Zoom call, here is everything you must understand and be aware of:

1. [Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android](#part2-1)
2. [Join Zoom meetings using a Zoom ID on Android](#part2-2)

* [How to Schedule a Zoom Meeting Android](#part3)

## Part 1\. How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android

There is no doubt that the Zoom app on an android device is easy to navigate through and put to use. All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here's how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:

* On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option "**New Meeting.**"

![new zoom meeting android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg)

* Now, opt for the selection of "**Start a Meeting.**" Once done, you will notice a video conference space.
