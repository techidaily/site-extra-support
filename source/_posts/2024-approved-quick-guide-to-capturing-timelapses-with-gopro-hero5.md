 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

These days more and more travel photographers are resorting to time lapse videos instead of the regular ones. No matter if you want to shoot nature, urban life, beaches, clouds or sunrise, compacting a couple of hours of footage into a few minutes can be rather powerful visual narrative.

A time lapse video is basically a sequence of photos which have been shot at an interval and then player with a much faster speed. The time interval in which the photos have been shot could vary from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the duration of the video you want to create. This is substantially different from a regular video where the photos are recorded in quick succession by the camera and then stringed together in real time. Time lapses can be a very handy tool for recording scenes which occur over a considerable period of time (for eg. Sunset, sunrise, eclipses, budding of flowers, clouds etc).

Are you an amateur travel photographer who has recently bought a GoPro cam and wondering which the best setting for time lapse photography is? Are you still not certain about which editing software to use for editing your GoPro time lapses? In this post we will discuss how to shoot a time lapse video with GoPro Hero 5 and how to edit the video with Filmora.

## Part 1: Shooting a time lapse video with GoPro Hero5

#### **1. The best time lapse settings in GoPro:**

Selecting the right setting is the most difficult part about shooting a GoPro time lapse. Here is what you need to do:

* At first, you need to set the right interval of shooting
* Next, you need to choose the optimal resolution
* Then, you have to select the exact playback rate
* Lastly, you need to decide on the length of your video.

Below parameters are the best time-lapse intervals for the GoPro Hero5 Black:

* 0.5s for up-close shooting birds, insects and other small moving things;
* 1.0s for filming in urban areas like flowing traffic, people, buses etc;
* 2.0s for shooting clouds as well as touristy areas;
* 5.0s for filming sunset, sunrise and normal moving clouds;
* 10s for shooting moving clouds and construction videos
* 30s for taking shots of shadows, drying puddles, thunderstorms etc.;
* 60s for blooming flowers, growing plants or any other long term process.

Choose 12 MP as the resolution and use 30 frames per second for your videos, which is the ideal settings for getting the most fluid-looking and realistic time-lapses. Now you need to decide on how long you want to shoot. While shooting at an interval of 60 seconds, you would have to place your camera on the location for quite some time, so as to get a time-lapse of considerable duration. If you shoot for 10 minutes with 1s interval, then you will be getting about 20 seconds of time lapse footage which is surely enough for creating a quick montage.

#### **2. Tips before your shoot**

First, you need to look for the right location. Make the most out of the rule of thirds and always ensure that you have a focal point of your time lapse footage. While shooting a crowded street try to position your camera at a vantage point from where you can capture the movement of the people and even that of the clouds.

Make use of good tripod, a fast and spacious SD card, a suction mount and always keep an extra battery. Gorilla Pod with its 3 in 1 mount is probably the best tripod for action cams. A longer cord can be of great help in situations where you have a power source. This would allow you to shoot hours and hours of footage on your GoPro.

#### **3. Steps for making your time lapse video**

1. Switch on your GoPro Hero5
2. Tap the shooting mode icon at the bottom of the left
3. Tap the time lapse icon located on the right of the screen and choose time lapse video
4. Select your settings by going to Res, FOV and Interval
5. Tap on the screen to make the settings disappear
6. Press the record button to shoot
7. Now download your recorded video by connecting your camera or by using an SD card reader.
