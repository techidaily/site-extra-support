### Step 6\. Incorporate LUTs into your Project

Head over to the LUTs tab in your 3D LUT mobile. For convenience, you will notice that LUTs are arranged in folders. Some of the folders include; Editor’s Pick, Mobile Weekly, Grading, Black& White, Top25, and UsersUploads.

Hover through the folders, and once you find one that seems to suit your needs, open it. From the folder, there are various LUts. Navigate through the folder you have selected and match the LUTs with your project image.

Once you find a suitable LUT, use the cursor on the right hand of your image to adjust the levels of LUT in your photo. You can shift to the “basic” section if you find some required corrections and amend them. Once you make a certain adjustment, your changes are automatically updated.
