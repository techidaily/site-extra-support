Some of the effects are applicable to the whole clip, while some are meant to be placed at particular locations over the clip. Slide on the â€˜Attach to a pointâ€™ toggle, so it makes the effect move or stay fixed, depending on the object it is fixed to.
3. Click â€˜Deleteâ€™ if you want to remove 3D effects. Hit â€˜Doneâ€™ for saving the changes.

## Part 6: How to export a Story Remix video

Now that you have learnt how to edit videos in Story Remix, letâ€™s see how can you export or share them with the world. You can directly share from Photos or use a USB drive to do the needful.

1. Click on the project name > give a new name > â€˜Enterâ€™.
2. Press â€˜Export or shareâ€™ > â€˜Sâ€™/â€™Mâ€™/â€™Lâ€™.

**Note**: S is for mobile and email with a small video, M is for social media uploads, and L is meant for large Remix videos meant for large screens.

The file location is displayed soon after you create the video by the Photos app. On wanting to share the video, just hit on â€˜Share to social media, email, or other appsâ€™.

Now, pick the app or contact and send the video.

Recent videos are found on â€˜Collectionsâ€™ section if they are auto created. Otherwise, all the Story Remix files are located permanently on â€˜Creationsâ€™ section.
