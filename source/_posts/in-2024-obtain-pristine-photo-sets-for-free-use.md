## Obtain Pristine Photo Sets for Free Use

Stock images are a valuable resource for any creator. Most companies use them to advertise their merchandise and communicate their brand image. In addition, several stock photo providers allow you to use their creative assets for commercial purposes, such as Unsplash, Shutterstock, and Pixabay. Unfortunately, some do not allow you to download stock images without a watermark. This is because of the unique licenses they offer with their content.

Keep reading to learn more about downloading stock images without watermarks. In addition, you will discover if it is OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use.

## Part1:Why not use stock photos with watermarks?

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![watermarks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-1.jpg)

This is because it infringes on the image's copyright, which can land you in legal trouble. In addition, stock photo contributors can choose to include watermarks in their images as a way of copyrighting their work. As such, they can command royalty payments from the stock photograph website and other users who download their images.

In addition, the stock photos watermark informs other users who to contact when they want to use your images for personal and commercial use. Therefore, they can sue you for extra damages if you use their images without purchasing the rights.

Another reason why it is not OK to use stock photos with watermarks for commercial use is that it looks unprofessional. Typically, stock photo watermarks cover the middle of the photo, making it near unusable for potential copyright violators. In addition, using a watermarked stock photo for your messaging can harm your brand. This is because it indicates to your audience that you are cheap and do not appreciate other people's hard work.

### Method 1: Go to Free stock sites

Stock photos are images you can use in your personal and commercial works, such as to create your logo or for marketing purposes. Although some sites require you to pay to use their content, there are plenty more that offer their images for free. Below are some of the sites you should check out.

* **Unsplash.com**

### Method 4: Use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get free stock media resources

![get free stock media resources](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photos-watermark-5.jpg)

You can also use Wondershare Filmora to get free stock media resources for your commercial creations. The video editing software features Filmstock, a library of stock content, including images, videos, royalty-free sound effects, and music.

In addition, Filmora integrates Unsplash.com, pixabay.com, and many other stock media sites into the software. Here is how you can access free stock media resources through Filmstock.

* Launch the Filmora Video Editor from your device.
* Click on **New Project** to access the project workspace.
* Tap on the **Effects** tab and press the **Filmstock** button.

Instead, you can avoid legal liability by purchasing the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Business Plan.

## Part3: FAQs
