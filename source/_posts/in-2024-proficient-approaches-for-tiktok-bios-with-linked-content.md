## Part 4: What If You Can’t See the Option to Add a Link to Your TikTok Bio?

Are you unable to add a link to the TikTok bio? In this section, you can find the possible reasons why you can't see the option of adding a link to your bio:

* **Business Account or Individual Account:** Individual TikTok accounts have restrictions on adding the website link. If you can’t see the option of adding the link of a website to the TikTok bio, it means you are not using the business account.

* **Unavailability in Some Regions:** If you have met the above requirements and are still unable to add a website link to your TikTok bio, it means this feature is not available in your region because of location limitations. There are some regions where TikTok business accounts are not available. Only regions like the United States, the UK, and Canada have TikTok business accounts.
* **Using TikTok Website:** Currently, TikTok only allows users to use the mobile app to add links to their bio. If you are using the website version of TikTok, you cannot add a link to your bio and have to download the mobile version to complete the process.
