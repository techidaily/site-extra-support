### 1\. Hyperlapse from Instagram

Although Hyperlapse isn't a recent addition to the App Store, the Instagram spin-off provides creative people with a simple and amazingly efficient means of presenting a narrative in video. The free app has two standout features: timelapse, which allows you to film initially and then speed up afterward, and Instagram's in-house stabilization, which does an excellent job of eradicating handheld wobbling.

The result is a video clip that condenses full dawn, stroll to work, or airline take-off into a few seconds, all while maintaining the trademark silky smooth Hyperlapse appearance.

### **How to Stabilize a Video Using Hyperlapse from Instagram?**

## Part 4: Tips for Shooting Stable Videos with iPhone

The first step to capturing a stabilized video is to understand what your phone is capable of and how to deal with it while capturing smartphone films. As long as you apply the following criteria, your smartphone should react to realistic hand movements:

**Grip Properly**

If you can mount your iPhone to a tripod, then great. However, if it's not possible, you need to firmly hold your phone in your hand and stay still to capture a stabilized video. By keeping the phone firmly in your hand, you can avoid all the shakiness that will result in stabilization.

**Trigger Remotely**

One more step to avoid the shakiness is starting the video with remote triggers. It's better to start the video with your Headphone's volume button because, in that way, you won't need to touch the screen that can destabilize your video.

**Favor the Volume Button**

Another helpful thing for capturing a stabilized video is to favor your phone's Volume Buttons. iPhone allows the user to capture the video as long as they hold the Volume and Power buttons. S, capture the video with the help of Volume Buttons.

**Conclusion**

So, those are some of the methods to **stabilize iPhone video**. You have a variety of alternatives depending on how far you are ready to go to get that steady shot. You may also utilize a mix of the approaches mentioned above and technologies to create an expert vlog, podcast, instructive video, and more.
