A privacy switch is included with the CA20\. Although the camera doesn't come with a tripod of its own, it does include a tripod thread so you may attach one.

## Part 2: How to Choose the Best Webcam for Zoom

With the above options, how to pick the best Zoom webcam is rather clear. A webcam's sharpness is limited by how many pixels its sensor can resolve. A good camera typically has a resolution of 1080p, but if you truly want to improve the quality of your images (or be able to trim your frame without losing sharpness), you should get a 4K webcam. Even the greatest webcams struggle in a dim environment, so proper lighting is essential if you want a clear, crisp image. Although they may be beneficial, sunshine and overhead lighting are seldom constant and aren't always perfect. Here are some other noteworthy factors to think about:

**Frame Rate:**

Frame Rate (FPS) is the number of images (frames) that your webcam takes in a second. A smoother streaming experience results from a higher frame rate. The majority of the top webcams can broadcast at 30 frames per second or more. Your video's frame rate has an impact on how smooth it seems. Pay special attention to the specifications before purchasing since a 60fps camera will provide you with a lot more realistic and natural video stream than a 30fps webcam would.

**AI Autofocus:**

Additionally, a feature known as AI autofocus, which combines autofocus with digital zoom to center the picture on your face as you move around inside the camera's field of view, is available on certain higher-resolution cameras. Although this is a useful function, it cannot take the place of correctly framing the photo.

**Video Resolution:**

This determines how clear the video will be and is expressed in pixels of width by height. The three most popular webcam resolutions are 3840 x 2160 pixels (4K), 1920 x 1080 pixels (1080p), and 1280 x 720 pixels (720p) (HD Ready) (UHD).

**Integrated Microphone:**

A built-in microphone is a feature that many webcams include, making them a one-stop shop for video chats. Although some webcams produce audio that is of a higher caliber than others, they often produce sound that is not as clear and undistorted as that of specialized USB microphones. Most webcams work great for typical meetings and chats, but you will probably need a separate microphone if you're streaming or concerned about providing the finest audio quality during video conversations.

**Webcam Auto Focus:**

Webcams should autofocus on the person or object in the picture, and some of the better ones can lock on focus or follow the topic to make it seem as if a cameraman is shooting you.

**Field Of View (FOV):**

The breadth of the region that the webcam is capturing is determined by the field of view (FOV), which is expressed in degrees. The more of your backdrop that is in the photograph depends on the FOV. The best cameras let you choose between a large FOV and a tight FOV.

**Lighting:**

Low-light level adjustment: Many of the top webcams include low-light boosting capabilities that restore quality to the frame's shadows, increasing the dynamic range. More clarity and improved exposure in low light are the results.

**Real-time Effects:**

Modern web cams enable you to do green screening and chroma key effects without a real green screen, allowing you to modify your backdrop or completely block it out.

## Part 2: How to Choose the Best Webcam for Zoom

With the above options, how to pick the best Zoom webcam is rather clear. A webcam's sharpness is limited by how many pixels its sensor can resolve. A good camera typically has a resolution of 1080p, but if you truly want to improve the quality of your images (or be able to trim your frame without losing sharpness), you should get a 4K webcam. Even the greatest webcams struggle in a dim environment, so proper lighting is essential if you want a clear, crisp image. Although they may be beneficial, sunshine and overhead lighting are seldom constant and aren't always perfect. Here are some other noteworthy factors to think about:

**Frame Rate:**

Frame Rate (FPS) is the number of images (frames) that your webcam takes in a second. A smoother streaming experience results from a higher frame rate. The majority of the top webcams can broadcast at 30 frames per second or more. Your video's frame rate has an impact on how smooth it seems. Pay special attention to the specifications before purchasing since a 60fps camera will provide you with a lot more realistic and natural video stream than a 30fps webcam would.

**AI Autofocus:**

Additionally, a feature known as AI autofocus, which combines autofocus with digital zoom to center the picture on your face as you move around inside the camera's field of view, is available on certain higher-resolution cameras. Although this is a useful function, it cannot take the place of correctly framing the photo.

**Video Resolution:**

This determines how clear the video will be and is expressed in pixels of width by height. The three most popular webcam resolutions are 3840 x 2160 pixels (4K), 1920 x 1080 pixels (1080p), and 1280 x 720 pixels (720p) (HD Ready) (UHD).

**Integrated Microphone:**

A built-in microphone is a feature that many webcams include, making them a one-stop shop for video chats. Although some webcams produce audio that is of a higher caliber than others, they often produce sound that is not as clear and undistorted as that of specialized USB microphones. Most webcams work great for typical meetings and chats, but you will probably need a separate microphone if you're streaming or concerned about providing the finest audio quality during video conversations.

**Webcam Auto Focus:**

Webcams should autofocus on the person or object in the picture, and some of the better ones can lock on focus or follow the topic to make it seem as if a cameraman is shooting you.

**Field Of View (FOV):**

The breadth of the region that the webcam is capturing is determined by the field of view (FOV), which is expressed in degrees. The more of your backdrop that is in the photograph depends on the FOV. The best cameras let you choose between a large FOV and a tight FOV.

**Lighting:**

Low-light level adjustment: Many of the top webcams include low-light boosting capabilities that restore quality to the frame's shadows, increasing the dynamic range. More clarity and improved exposure in low light are the results.

**Real-time Effects:**

Modern web cams enable you to do green screening and chroma key effects without a real green screen, allowing you to modify your backdrop or completely block it out.
