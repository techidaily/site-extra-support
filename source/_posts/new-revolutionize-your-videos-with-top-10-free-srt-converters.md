## Revolutionize Your Videos with Top 10 Free SRT Converters

In movies, subtitles are essential for translation purposes (for foreign language movies) or as a glossary for meaning (explaining localized/unknown idioms, terms, definitions, slang, etc.). Plus, subtitles also work as an informative tool, adding legible text at the side of videos explaining particular concepts or additional information not covered in the video.

While creating or editing videos, using an **online subtitle converter** will help you insert such elements in the project directly from the text, audio clips, or the video itself. If you are concerned about which to use, here is a comprehensive list for you.

## Part 3: The Compliance with Subtitle Guideline Presets on Video Software

It is important to properly check which type of subtitle format the video software types work well with before opting for one. Multiple options are available that offer one or two types of compatibility only. On the other hand, some other software options are available that work with only one guideline preset. Here are the common distinctions.

| SRT                            | VTT | STL | DFXP | iTT |     |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |

## Part 4: How to Choose the Best Online SRT converter?

Now that you know what compliance matters to consider and the types of available options for **mp4 to SRT converter online free,** you should make your final choice. However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.

**(1) Simple to use**

The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the "Edit" button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the "Subtitle" tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.

Most **Sub to SRT converter online** requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.

**(2) Using experience**

The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.

**(3) Format supported**

* **Video formats:** AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.
* **Subtitle formats:** SRT, ASS, SSA

While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what's happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.

So, when you are using a **TXT to SRT converter online**, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.

For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles.

## Part 3: The Compliance with Subtitle Guideline Presets on Video Software

It is important to properly check which type of subtitle format the video software types work well with before opting for one. Multiple options are available that offer one or two types of compatibility only. On the other hand, some other software options are available that work with only one guideline preset. Here are the common distinctions.

| SRT                            | VTT | STL | DFXP | iTT |     |
| ------------------------------ | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| **Filmora**                    | Yes | \-  | \-   | \-  | \-  |
| **Final Cut Pro X**            | Yes | \-  | \-   | \-  | Yes |
| **AVID Media Composer**        | \-  | \-  | Yes  | \-  | \-  |
| **Adobe Premiere Pro**         | Yes | \-  | Yes  | \-  | \-  |
| **Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve** | Yes | \-  | \-   | \-  | \-  |
| **Vimeo**                      | Yes | Yes | \-   | Yes | \-  |
| **YouTube**                    | Yes | Yes | \-   | \-  | \-  |

## Part 4: How to Choose the Best Online SRT converter?

Now that you know what compliance matters to consider and the types of available options for **mp4 to SRT converter online free,** you should make your final choice. However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.

**(1) Simple to use**

The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the "Edit" button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the "Subtitle" tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.

Most **Sub to SRT converter online** requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.

**(2) Using experience**

The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.

**(3) Format supported**

* **Video formats:** AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.
* **Subtitle formats:** SRT, ASS, SSA

While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what's happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.

So, when you are using a **TXT to SRT converter online**, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.
