## Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?

Let’s say you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine as a single collage. Now, if you do it manually, then it will consume a lot of time and you won’t get a polished product.

You can just select any preferred photo grid collage maker and upload your photos to the layout. The photo grid app would present your images in a visually appealing way and would also let you add texts, stickers, filters, and so much more.
