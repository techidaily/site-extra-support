## Part1: Organize Photo Album on iPhone

### Introducing Default Albums

The introduction of the iCloud drive that is usually supported by the devices iOS 5 and iPhone 3Gs and the later models, has made the iPhone photo album organization quite easy and hassle free. Apart from the ‘all photo album’, there are few default albums as well. What are the default albums? The images or the photos are often categorized as the selfies or screenshots favorites, etc. The iPhone automatically create and name the albums to a particular category of videos or photos, which are usually known as the default albums. Whether you are looking for a selfie clicked last month or a family group selfie, you just need to search a particular photo album as per your requirement. The various default album categories usually created are-

![Default Albums](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/iPhone-Photo-Albums.jpg)

Videos album- You can find all the videos at one folder in video album.

Selfies- The images that require a front facing camera captures, are automatically stored in the Selfie album.

Favorites- If you are in love with any of the image clicked and wish to see it frequently, you may make photo directly on the favorites album, instead of searching it all over again and again.

Screenshots- When you press the home and power button together, the screenshots of your iPhone are created and saved in the Screenshots photo album.

Places- Have you enabled location services on your iPhone? If so, then this is an ultimate way to recollect when and where you went and clicked any particular or all Apple iPhone photos at one place.

People- If any person is detected in your photo, it is stored in iPhone photos album.

Recently Deleted- Did you delete any favorite iPhone photos and regretting the same? Don’t worry, now you may retrieve the apple iPhone photos within 29 days of deleting the same. Go to ‘recently deleted’ iPhone photo album to retrieve the deleted iPhone photos.

Other than the default iPhone photo albums, you may create your own customized photo albums too.
