## How to Efficiently Edit GoPro Videos?

Editing GoPro videos can be a wonderful and fun experience, especially with the right tools. Filmora seems like a handy GoPro video editor for improving your GoPro vlog or usual GoPro video. This platform offers a number of diverse features that help to make your GoPro edit a masterpiece.

Below we will be talking about these creative features and how you can actually utilize them for your GoPro 360 camera shots. So, without further ado, let's dive into these GoPro video editor functions one by one.

The fisheye effect can cause unwanted distortions, making straight lines appear curved and objects appear stretched or bent near the edges of the frame. To correct this distortion in your GoPro video, you can follow these steps using Filmora:

1. **Launch Filmora and Import Footage**: Begin by opening Filmora, and import the GoPro footage you want to correct. You can do this by clicking on the "Import" or "Import Media Files" option, which allows you to browse your computer and select the desired clips.
2. **Find the "Lens Correction" Option**: Within the "Correction" tab, you should find the "Lens Correction" option.
3. **Apply Lens Correction:** After selecting the "Lens Correction" option, Filmora will provide you with various controls and settings to correct the fisheye effect.
4. **Adjust the Slider**: Once you've applied the lens correction, you'll likely see a slider or multiple sliders that allow you to control the level of correction.
5. **Preview:** After making adjustments, review your footage to ensure that the fisheye distortion is adequately corrected. Pay attention to details near the edges of the frame to ensure they look natural.

### Video Speed Adjustment

Video speed adjustment is a crucial tool when it comes to video editing. It allows you to control the pace and timing of your GoPro video, enhancing the storytelling or achieving specific creative effects. To utilize this crucial effect follow the below steps:

1. Choose the clip you want to adjust.
2. Find the "Speed" option in the toolbar.
