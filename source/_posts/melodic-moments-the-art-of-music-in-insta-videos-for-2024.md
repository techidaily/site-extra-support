You have the choice of leaning into Artificial Intelligence assisted video editing. This is brought to life in options like Auto Normalization, Auto Highlight, Auto Reframe, AI Portrait, and AR Stickers.

● Auto Highlight helps you save valuable time by extracting the highlights of the clip. For example, this can help you post a video teaser as a thumbnail or trim the video to get good results.

● Auto Reframe can help you crop your videos with the focal point always staying in the center frame.

● Now we get to see the cool stuff in action. The AI Portrait removes video backgrounds. Of course, it works best when you have a single subject composition. It also has provisions for adding borders, video effects, and more!
