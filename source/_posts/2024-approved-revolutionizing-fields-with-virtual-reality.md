## VR museum exhibits

 Using a data glove will allow you to interact further with certain exhibits and stereoscopic lenses on glasses can even allow them to walk around a 3D object and see if from different angles. This technology would be extremely useful for people to see an artefact they would otherwise have to look through the paned glass to see.

## VR time travel

 If you have ever wondered what it feels like to step back in time, the virtual reality technology could allow you to walk through whole houses, streets, towns and more by building a tracking system into glasses which is fed back to the computer so that the wearers perception is changed yet given realism.

 Rather than just focussing on taking people into new worlds, the future of virtual reality is also going to be able to take people back in time to events that happened so that they can be relived once again. Imagine the implications this could have for people that have lost loved ones, want to show a child their father that died before they were born or mother during childbirth. The fact that it is heading in the direction of being able to recreate scenes that have passed could also have a great impact on solving crimes, training military to deal with certain situations with more realism and even help people to see where they have gone wrong.

## VR in the film industry

 For the film industry rather than just being a spectator looking at the screen you could feel, see and hear what is going on around you. Other sensory tools could also be added such as smells and more intense touch such as soft, cold, hot to give you a more realistic experience. In the medical field it could enable training practitioners to perform surgeries and medical care before they are introduced to real patients. The possibilities for the future of virtual reality are endless.

## VR applications in entertainment

 Virtual reality has long been used to enthral users looking for entertainment beyond the real world. It is allowing people to see virtual and interactive exhibitions without them actually being present, get involved with performances at the theatre with interactive performances and even get on hair raising rides without the ride being present, built or to enhance the experience.

 In the gaming section it is already being discussed how virtual reality games may not be as far in the future as you may think. Many of the popular gaming companies are heading this way to give their fans a whole new experience.

## VR applications for virtual theme parks

 Having virtual theme parks could save on cost, upkeep, staffing and many other aspects yet still allow visitors to have fun on rides that are beyond physically able to build or too expensive to be of profit.

## VR holidays/visits off this planet

 People would be able to walk on different planets without leaving planet earth and travel to countries that don’t even exist, or are out of reach financially or physically to the general public.
