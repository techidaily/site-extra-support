## Silent Symphony: Softening Computer Sounds System-Wide

Musicians all around the world keep on searching for music in every little thing in the world. Thus, they have a professional sense of judging and creating music to implement new ideas, music decors, autotunes, and fade-in and fade-out concepts. In case you do not know what music Fade in and fade out is, then for your information, these are sound effects where the **Fade in-music** effect is usually used at the beginning of the song.

It begins from absolute silence to smooth melody; the music fade-out effect is generally implemented at the end of the song which slowly goes silent from the melodious tune.

**Why Do People Use Fade In/Out Effects?**

However, it sometimes happens that the professionally composed music might not sound great due to such abrupt endings or starting. This is when such musical effects come to the rescue.
