Its users cannot capture new images and they must use footage that already exists, which limits the creative output of the GIF maker. However, the process of creating a GIF with GIF Toaster couldn't be simpler, since all you have to do to create a GIF is select photos or a video, adjust the encoding options and tap on the Start Encoding button.
