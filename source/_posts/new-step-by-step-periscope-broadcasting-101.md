 There are ways to gain their confidence; either by a Q & A session after the broadcast or a live chat window alongside your broadcast to engage the audience. Create the curiosity to let them come back for the next live video streaming.

#### Set your goals

 Like everything else, set a goal while planning a broadcast in Periscope. Invest sometime in getting to know the location before you start broadcasting, so that you can capture the things at the best angle while filming. Internet connectivity should be at its best to allow you uninterrupted live streaming. It’s better if you have a backup.

 Ensure that you have spread the word and scheduled the broadcasting ahead, so that your viewers know how and when to wait for it. Extensively promote it through social media and other online marketing channels. Let them find you easily and be a part of your online broadcast.
