### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time. Effects act like filters that can change the color range of your picture, and each effect has a unique quality. The effects offered in this tool are atomic, creative, unicolor, vintage, and too old.

On the other hand, people like to use the feature of overlays to add extra layers and texture to their images for enhancement. Pixlr photo editor offers diverse effects and provides high-quality overlays that you can apply to the picture. Using these options, anyone can convert dull pictures into vibrant and lively ones.

### 10\. Heal and Smooth the Image

Another unique feature of Pixlr photo editor is healing and smooth brushes that can eradicate the irregularities and imperfections on your picture naturally.

You can also use options of shade and shine that work as natural filters that results in a perfect picture.
