Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.

Signing up with a free account allows a free, instant 2k download. However, 20k high-resolution images are behind a paywall and require a premium subscription before you can download them. Hdri-Skies also has 28 volumes of payable full-spherical Skylum aurora hdr for professional use.

**Our Verdict**

Keeping the website free of ads makes it easier to choose the perfect panorama. By giving free access to high-quality images, Hdri-skies is good enough for young digital artists who have just stepped into the field and looking for helpful resources.

However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.
