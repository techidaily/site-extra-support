You might have observed the outstanding service offers by HP models where users can easily control all applications on their device with simple drag, point and swipe like motions on screen surface; as well as you can us mouse and keyboard. Most of the systems these days are designed with capacitive touch system that offers great conductivity for every touch of human finger. The most interesting one is 10 point advanced capacitive touch system that allows users to enjoy multi touch functionality on their device screen.

## Things to Consider When Buying 4K All-in-One Touchscreen PC

1. **Graphics Chip:**

 You might have seen that most of desktops usually rely on their integrated graphic design that is added to processors but with the new technologies now gamers can expect much impressive quality with new dedicated graphic controls. You can buy this device in two configurations: 24 inch and classic 27 inch. Generally the 10 series unique “Pascal” graphic chips offer great gaming experience but when we talk about True gaming AIOs then users can expect classic touch screen response for their gaming needs. Buyers are advised to avoid spending on last generation Maxwell unless it sellers offer you great discount.

1. **Optical Drives & Audio:**

 Most of the advanced models of multimedia devices do not have optical drive support; you will find very rare models that allow Blu-ray Discs and DVD playback with built in tray drive. But today you need to use a USB type CD/DVD drive to gain control over optical discs. Most of the manufacturers these days offer AIO systems for impressive sound quality but it is good to test one before you buy.

1. **Core Connectivity:**

 When to go to buy a consumer PC then it is good to check for inbuilt WI-FI support with 802.11ac standard. Never forget to check the side mounted ports like USB because they will assist you to make easy connections with external world. The systems with HDMI port must be given higher priority because it assist users to enjoy all in one display performance with gaming consol as well as with cable box.

1. **Screen Tilt:**

 Some of the most widely preferred screen sizes include 27, 24 and 23 inch displays- note that it is measured diagonally. Commonly, most of the consumer systems come with full HD display capability or offer 1080p resolution level. Those who have already worked with HP 150 must be aware about how tiring its vertical display appears when you have to lift your hand again and again to initiate touch controls. When you need to use your device for long hours then it is always better to have a little tilted back screen so that the shallower angle can serve you with better and comfortable controls. It is good to think about AIO’s stand, they offer wide range of motion and some can tilt up to higher angle.
