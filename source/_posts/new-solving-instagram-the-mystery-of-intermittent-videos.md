## Solving Instagram: The Mystery of Intermittent Videos

We realize how aggravating it is when Instagram rotates your videos automatically. Instagram saves an orientation code and instantly adjusts an image or video if it isn't in the correct alignment. Regrettably, their programming isn't always accurate.

Now, if you want to learn and master how to fix this irritating issue, I suggest that you continue reading.

## **Why Is Instagram Constantly Flipping Your Video?**

When you post a video using your camera roll to Instagram Stories, it will automatically crop it to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Before you begin filming horizontally, you may need to manually correct your phone camera's direction. Failure to do so may result in films being posted sideways.

## **How To Rotate Videos on Instagram?**

You've created the ideal video, but it's on its side or upside down? In a couple of seconds, rotate and adjust your movie.

In the uploading process, Instagram users are unable to rotate their videos. However, you may apply filters to your video, mute or clip it, and replace the cover photo.

To help you rotate your Instagram videos, I prepared a list of alternatives below:

### **#1:** Wondershare Filmora

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Phone.**

You can rotate your clip with Wondershare Filmora to whatever angle you choose. Furthermore, you may easily zoom or crop the sections of the video that you don't want to see. It also includes predefined aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, and others to help you quickly discover the ideal aspect ratio for YouTube, Instagram, and other sites.

Let's look at how to modify the aspect ratio of a video in Filmora below:

1. Drag the media files to the timeline after importing them into Filmora.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-1.jpg)

1. To access the video editing window, double-click on the clip in the timeline. Locate the "Rotate" option under the "Transform" menu. You can alter the rotation value by dragging the slider or entering a specific amount. Up to 360 degrees of rotation is possible. For example, if you wish to rotate this clip 90 degrees, you may type "90" in the box, and it will rotate the video.

This unique feature in Wondershare Filmora allows users to enhance their video editing possibilities.

Free Video Flip and Rotate is a free Windows software that, as the name implies, flips or rotates video images to restore them to their original aspect.

Your clip can also be rotated vertically and horizontally using Free Video Flip and Rotate. This is extremely useful when fixing and adjusting the orientation of the source video. The only negative of this software is that it offers to download a browser toolbar, which you can disable during installation.

### **#4:** VLC Media Player

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

Start flipping your videos with Video Rotator with the following steps below:

### **#4:** VLC Media Player

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

### **Is The Camera on Instagram Inverted?**

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

This occurs because most individuals use their phone cameras upside down, requiring them to turn a photo from their camera roll horizontal before publishing it on Instagram.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-1.jpg)

1. To access the video editing window, double-click on the clip in the timeline. Locate the "Rotate" option under the "Transform" menu. You can alter the rotation value by dragging the slider or entering a specific amount. Up to 360 degrees of rotation is possible.

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

This occurs because most individuals use their phone cameras upside down, requiring them to turn a photo from their camera roll horizontal before publishing it on Instagram.

### **#4:** VLC Media Player

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

### **#5:** RotateMyVideo.net

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Phone, and Online.**

The Rotate My Video feature is the last but not least. My favorite advantage about this software is that it isn't a program but rather a simple link!

You can immediately upload your movie to rotatemyvideo.net and rotate it as desired. The only disadvantage may be the time spent uploading and then saving it to your hard disk.

So, how do you flip a video using rotatemyvideo.net? Don't worry because you may follow the steps below:

1. Go to rotatemyvideo.net website.

2. Open [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
3. Drag and drop your video clips in the timeline.
4. Rotate your video to your desired aspect ratio.
5. Export your final output.

### **What Is the Best Way to Flip a Video?**

You can use a video editing software to flip a video. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the finest software in the market. You can flip your video with just minimal effort right away. You may also add effects and many more with this video editing software.

### **Is The Camera on Instagram Inverted?**

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

This occurs because most individuals use their phone cameras upside down, requiring them to turn a photo from their camera roll horizontal before publishing it on Instagram.
