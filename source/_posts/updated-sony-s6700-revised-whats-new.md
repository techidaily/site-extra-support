## Features

The BDP-S6700 is capable enough to fulfil almost all requirements of buyers, it provides eye catching results for Blu-ray, can spin 3D discs, processed CDs and DVDs with high quality content but it lacks to provide support for DVD audio. You will be glad to know that this device can perfectly handle DTS HD Master audio and Dolby TrueHD content. Users can enjoy playing all popular file formats on this player like DSD, ALAC, FLAC, WAV and MP3 etc. The best part is that video side support is extended up to AVCHD, WMV and MKV and content can be transferred via USB and Wi-Fi.

Further, you can enjoy DLNA connectivity and Miracast screen mirroring facility for displaying content on smartphones or TV screen directly.

## Verdict

There are so many ultra HD Blu-ray players in market but impressive design and feature rich performance of Sony BDP-S6700 makes it stand out among all competitors.

Users can enjoy music streaming via Bluetooth but the sad part is that it cannot work on iOS devices. If you are an android user and searching for some compatible Blu-Ray players then go for BDP-S6700.
