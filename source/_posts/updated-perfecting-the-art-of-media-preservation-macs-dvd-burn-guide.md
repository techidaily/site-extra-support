But even if you already have the footage and do not want to edit anything in it — the Filmora software can help you with that. All you have to do is follow these simple steps:

**Step 1: Install Filmora on Mac.**

Open the software and from the main interface, and click on ‘Import’ to upload the files to software. You can upload anything — photos and audios — not only videos.

**Step 2: Add video to timeline**

The program is so simple that you do not need to possess any technical knowledge about DVD burning. All you have to do is drag and drop the files to the timeline and then click the Export button to save the video to DVD.

Meanwhile, you can also edit the videos if you like before clicking on Export. For instance, you can simply utilize the one-click preset options to apply effects, transition, and more. Or you can color-correct the video files, crop, trim, split, or do several other things before burning the video to DVD. The preview section allows you to view the edited video.

**Step 3:** **Export video to DVD**

After editing, you click on Export toggle and hover to the ‘DVD’ section within the Export options. You can choose other options present. Finally, you can burn video to DVD in DVD disc, DVD folder, and ISO disc image file format
