While physical offices are closed, services like Zoom for win10, which provide online meetings and video conversations, are more important than ever for keeping organizations operating effectively.

Fortunately, installing Zoom on your PC is a quick and easy procedure that will have you using the service in no time. One of the most popular video conferencing systems is now Zoom. You may have noticed that you didn't have to register to attend if you've ever attended a Zoom win 7 meeting.

Step1Launch the web browser on your computer and go to Zoom.us to access the Zoom website. In the website's footer, at the bottom of the page, click Download tab and the options are visible as follows:
