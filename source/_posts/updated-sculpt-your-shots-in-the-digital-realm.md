### How to Distort a Picture on Mobile

Uploading pics on social media is exciting. But sometimes it can be boring if you display the same expression numerous times. Luckily, there are many distorted face apps for iOS and Android mobile devices.

Playing with expressions can be enough to create funny photos. Sometimes a face distortion app is what you need to produce unique images for a different purpose, including annoying close people, jokes, and memes. A distorted face app can turn a pic into an unrecognizable image after completely editing it.

Photo Warp is one of the best distortion apps for Android and iOS devices. The app allows you to get more creative with your pics.

This distorted face app will help you get more creative with your photos, caricatures, and GIFs. It is free to download the app and use its editor features to make ordinary images funny by distorting them.

Photo Warp allows you to drag the face on your pic, zoom in, make an attention-grabbing cheese-eating grin, distort legs, stretch arms, and turn it into a GIF. With just one click, you can buff your face up, make yourself thinner, or enlarge any part of the image.
