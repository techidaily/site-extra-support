This iPhone GIF maker is free and it doesn't contain in-app purchases, but the amount of options it provides is scarce. Its users cannot capture new images and they must use footage that already exists, which limits the creative output of the GIF maker. However, the process of creating a GIF with GIF Toaster couldn't be simpler, since all you have to do to create a GIF is select photos or a video, adjust the encoding options and tap on the Start Encoding button.
