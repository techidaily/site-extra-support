## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

## Way 4\. Using a Spyglass

In Minecraft, the spyglass is used to zoom in so that a player may see well at a greater distance than is typically feasible. This is incredibly helpful while exploring diverse biomes since it enhances your eyesight and makes it simple to find monsters or precious materials that are hidden from view. Players may now create a zooming item in Minecraft. The new Spyglass item that enables users to zoom in on certain places was introduced to Minecraft in the 1.17 release. The spyglass is a creatable item in Minecraft that enables users to alter their Field of Vision anytime they want to without visiting the settings page. On your Minecraft crafting table, you may create a spyglass.

Step1 Create a Spyglass by following the newest version guide of Minecraft.

![create a spyglass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-spyglass.jpg)

Step2 After that, put the Spyglass you just created in your menu bar and take a hold of it. When you use it, your eyesight will enlarge the area you are focusing on. The same effect as altering your FoV in the settings is achieved with this, but it is faster, simpler, and has more zooming. You cannot lower the FoV setting below 30 by altering it in the menu.

![spyglass options panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-options-panel.jpg)

Step3 However, you will always zoom in to 10% of your current Field of View while using your Spyglass. When using a spyglass, for instance, your zoom level will be 6 if your field of view is set to 60\. As a result, a Spyglass will allow you to see objects considerably further away.

![spyglass settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-settings.jpg)

Step4 On the crafting table, arrange 2 copper ingots and 1 amethyst shard in the exact same configuration as in the illustration below to create a spyglass.
