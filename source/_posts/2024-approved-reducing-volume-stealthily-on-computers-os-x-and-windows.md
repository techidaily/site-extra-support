## Reducing Volume Stealthily on Computers (OS X & Windows)

Musicians all around the world keep on searching for music in every little thing in the world. Thus, they have a professional sense of judging and creating music to implement new ideas, music decors, autotunes, and fade-in and fade-out concepts. In case you do not know what music Fade in and fade out is, then for your information, these are sound effects where the **Fade in-music** effect is usually used at the beginning of the song.

It begins from absolute silence to smooth melody; the music fade-out effect is generally implemented at the end of the song which slowly goes silent from the melodious tune.

**Why Do People Use Fade In/Out Effects?**

Now you might be confused about why musicians use such Fade in and out effects in their songs. The reason is relatively easy to understand; music does not always have any particular source or motive. Thus, it might appear abruptly in your head, out of nowhere. Shaping it and tuning it in the right way is the work of a musician.

However, it sometimes happens that the professionally composed music might not sound great due to such abrupt endings or starting. This is when such musical effects come to the rescue.
