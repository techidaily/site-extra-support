Gamers interested in a gaming monitor should look for one that's compatible with the PS5 and has all of the console's features. The PS5 is capable of rendering 4K content up to 120fps, but a 4k monitor at 60Hz would still work fine for gaming even though most TVs support only 4K @ 120Hz. PlayStation 5 doesn't support 1440p content, so unless you're looking for a 1080p resolution and a higher refresh rate, you should opt for the 4k option. Monitors are generally faster than TVs when it comes to input lag. You can still use them as workstations because they have ergonomic stands and are small.

![ps5-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png)

In fact, the PS5 is still relatively young, and like previous generations, the technology around it is playing catch-up and trying to harness the game-changing power of the upcoming console release. Though there is a strong pull to a big TV when it comes to PS5's visuals, many players seem to gravitate toward gaming monitors since they provide beautiful visuals and incredibly smooth gameplay and at times are much more affordable.

As long as you have a gaming monitor, there is no need to invest in a new TV. There are no screens that do not work with the new console in this roundup. In addition, to support HDR (High Dynamic Range), the PS5 offers the ability to play games in 4K. Playing the PS5 on these screens won't cause a noticeable lag or delay, since they're fast and responsive. Additionally, their single video output on the PS5 can be connected through an HDMI port.

We have compiled a list of the top 5 best monitors that you can find today. The options that we will discuss today are affordable for gamers, but they offer many excellent features that every gamer wants to have. So, let’s the options in detail one by one.

#### **1\. Acer Nitro XV282K KVbmiipruzx**

![acer-nitro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acer-nitro-poster.jpg)

**Key Features:**

* **Screen Size:** 28"
* **Screen Resolution:** 3840x2160
* **Max Refresh Rate:** 144 Hz
* **Display Type**: IPS
* **Variable Refresh Rate:** FreeSync

Acer Nitro XV282K KVbmiipruzx is the best PS5 gaming monitor with a 4k resolution. There's nothing really special about this 28-inch model, but its ergonomics are quite good. With its wide viewing angles and IPS panel, this is a great choice for playing co-op games. However, while it can handle reflections well and is reasonably bright, it might still struggle to deal with glare, so it won't be the best option in extremely bright places.

The monitor supports HDMI 2.1, making it one of the first to do so. As it provides a 144Hz maximum refresh rate, exceptional response times, and support VRR, the gaming experience is incredibly fluid and virtually tear-free. The scanning display provides an excellent color gamut, but HDR brightness is not sufficient to produce punchy, bright highlights. Moreover, it has a low contrast ratio, which makes blacks appear gray in the dark.

Aside from two HDMI 2.1 ports, there are four USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, and DisplayPort alternate mode, each offering 65W of power. It comes with built-in speakers and a blue light filter, which enables nighttime viewing to be more comfortable. Overall, this is a great high-refresh 4k monitor that should satisfy the majority of users.

#### **2\. ASUS CG32UQ, 32 Inch 4K**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![asus-cg32uq-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-cg32uq-poster.png)

**Key Features:**

* **Screen size:** 32“
* **Resolution:** 4K, 3840x2160p
* **Display technology:** LED
* **Aspect ratio:** 16:9
* **Hardware interface:** DisplayPort, HDMI
* **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz
* **Response time:** 5 ms
* **Item weight:**1 kg
* **Display resolution maximum:** 3840 x 2160 pixels

Many of the typical features of a 4K monitor are present here, but there are more than a few added benefits justifying its higher price tag. In addition to the ambient lighting (Halo Sync) that provides excellent glare reduction and reduced eye strain, this ASUS monitor features ASUS’s own proprietary LED technology.

Aside from HDR, it boasts a professional color gamut of 95%, meaning images will be vibrant and blacks will be dark (in contrast to non-HDR monitors, which can look grey). With most 4K HDM 2.0 monitors, you'll get capped at 60hz if you play on a PS5\. This should make for a very pleasing visual experience in conjunction with the above.

#### **3\. Philips Gaming 436M6VBPAB**

* **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz
* **Response time:** 4 ms
* **Item weight:**71 kg
* **Display resolution maximum:** 3840 x 2160 Pixels

Aside from being 60hz, 4K, and having a 4ms response time, it offers some other features, which drive its price up a bit from other models on the list. The device offers tons of ports including USB Type C, HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB 3.0, making it one of the most versatile accessories you can get. As with the ASUS CG32UQ, the HDR makes a difference with deep blacks and the Ambiglow feature, which is pretty awesome too, gives you a nice ambiance.

#### **4\. Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q**

This monitor is an excellent gaming device from Asus. This device has a stylish design, a fantastic build quality, and most importantly, it looks fantastic when streaming PS5 games. The 28-inch size isn't too small when it comes to size, and the fact that it's more affordable than many competitors is a big plus.

#### **5\. AOC U2879VF**

Gamers interested in a gaming monitor should look for one that's compatible with the PS5 and has all of the console's features. The PS5 is capable of rendering 4K content up to 120fps, but a 4k monitor at 60Hz would still work fine for gaming even though most TVs support only 4K @ 120Hz. PlayStation 5 doesn't support 1440p content, so unless you're looking for a 1080p resolution and a higher refresh rate, you should opt for the 4k option. Monitors are generally faster than TVs when it comes to input lag. You can still use them as workstations because they have ergonomic stands and are small.

![ps5-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ps5-poster.png)

In fact, the PS5 is still relatively young, and like previous generations, the technology around it is playing catch-up and trying to harness the game-changing power of the upcoming console release. Though there is a strong pull to a big TV when it comes to PS5's visuals, many players seem to gravitate toward gaming monitors since they provide beautiful visuals and incredibly smooth gameplay and at times are much more affordable.

As long as you have a gaming monitor, there is no need to invest in a new TV. There are no screens that do not work with the new console in this roundup. In addition, to support HDR (High Dynamic Range), the PS5 offers the ability to play games in 4K. Playing the PS5 on these screens won't cause a noticeable lag or delay, since they're fast and responsive. Additionally, their single video output on the PS5 can be connected through an HDMI port.

We have compiled a list of the top 5 best monitors that you can find today. The options that we will discuss today are affordable for gamers, but they offer many excellent features that every gamer wants to have. So, let’s the options in detail one by one.

#### **1\. Acer Nitro XV282K KVbmiipruzx**

![acer-nitro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acer-nitro-poster.jpg)

**Key Features:**

* **Screen Size:** 28"
* **Screen Resolution:** 3840x2160
* **Max Refresh Rate:** 144 Hz
* **Display Type**: IPS
* **Variable Refresh Rate:** FreeSync

Acer Nitro XV282K KVbmiipruzx is the best PS5 gaming monitor with a 4k resolution. There's nothing really special about this 28-inch model, but its ergonomics are quite good. With its wide viewing angles and IPS panel, this is a great choice for playing co-op games. However, while it can handle reflections well and is reasonably bright, it might still struggle to deal with glare, so it won't be the best option in extremely bright places.

The monitor supports HDMI 2.1, making it one of the first to do so. As it provides a 144Hz maximum refresh rate, exceptional response times, and support VRR, the gaming experience is incredibly fluid and virtually tear-free. The scanning display provides an excellent color gamut, but HDR brightness is not sufficient to produce punchy, bright highlights. Moreover, it has a low contrast ratio, which makes blacks appear gray in the dark.

Aside from two HDMI 2.1 ports, there are four USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, and DisplayPort alternate mode, each offering 65W of power. It comes with built-in speakers and a blue light filter, which enables nighttime viewing to be more comfortable. Overall, this is a great high-refresh 4k monitor that should satisfy the majority of users.

#### **2\. ASUS CG32UQ, 32 Inch 4K**

![asus-cg32uq-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-cg32uq-poster.png)

**Key Features:**

* **Screen size:** 32“
* **Resolution:** 4K, 3840x2160p
* **Display technology:** LED
* **Aspect ratio:** 16:9
* **Hardware interface:** DisplayPort, HDMI
* **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz
* **Response time:** 5 ms
* **Item weight:**1 kg
* **Display resolution maximum:** 3840 x 2160 pixels

Many of the typical features of a 4K monitor are present here, but there are more than a few added benefits justifying its higher price tag. In addition to the ambient lighting (Halo Sync) that provides excellent glare reduction and reduced eye strain, this ASUS monitor features ASUS’s own proprietary LED technology.

Aside from HDR, it boasts a professional color gamut of 95%, meaning images will be vibrant and blacks will be dark (in contrast to non-HDR monitors, which can look grey). With most 4K HDM 2.0 monitors, you'll get capped at 60hz if you play on a PS5\. This should make for a very pleasing visual experience in conjunction with the above.

#### **3\. Philips Gaming 436M6VBPAB**

![philips-436m6bvpab-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/philips-436m6bvpab-poster.jpg)

* **Response time:** 4 ms

The device offers tons of ports including USB Type C, HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB 3.0, making it one of the most versatile accessories you can get. As with the ASUS CG32UQ, the HDR makes a difference with deep blacks and the Ambiglow feature, which is pretty awesome too, gives you a nice ambiance.
