### 2\. Sign in a different account in Microsoft Store

You got to login with another Microsoft account to access Microsoft Store. It might be your existing Microsoft Store account undergoing some issues. This in turn might be affecting the Photos app from acting properly. Therefore, signing in a different account will help.

## Part 3: Alternative way to save photo from video
