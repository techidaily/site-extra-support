TIPS

‚óè VLC 2.2.8 works the best on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.

‚óè VLC 2.0.10 is the best VLC media player for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

‚óè The version VLC 0.9.10 has proven to be the best fit for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

‚óè For Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the VLC 0.8.6i should be used.

‚óè If you have Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, only go for VLC 0.8.4a.

‚óè Last but not least, users of Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah and 10.1 Puma should install VLC 0.7.0.
