### 08**Step 8\. (Optional) Edit**

If there are any changes that you want to make before downloading it or sending it over to friends and family, Google Photos, thankfully, offers an ‘Edit’ Function that has basic photo editing features that you can use to make some minor changes to the collage.

## Part 2 **How to Make a Photo Collage with Google Photos on Google Photos Application**

Up, next we’ll be teaching you **how to make a collage in Google Photos** (app version) Specifically, we’ll be demonstrating with an iPhone — but you can do this with just about any smartphone or tablet. All you need is a log-in for Google.

### 01**Step 1\. Download Google Photos App**

First of all, in order to have **Google Photos make collage**s for you, you need the app. You can download this on the App-Store. It’s FREE-to-use.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 02**Step 2\. Allow Google Access to ‘All Photos’**

In order to proceed, you’ll need to give Google Photos permission to access all the photos on your device.
