## Method 2 to get Windows Photo Viewer back

Here comes another way to restore Windows Photo Viewer on your computer. If your computer has been upgraded to Windows 10 from an older version, then Windows Photo Viewer might be lying around somewhere. You can retrieve it to view images.

Here is the detailed guide –

**Step 1** – Go to the image or picture folder on your Windows 10 computer and right click on any image. Now, choose ‘Open With’ and click on ‘Choose another app’.

**Step 2** – Tap the ‘More apps’ option here in case, you can’t find out the Windows Photo Viewer within the list.

**Step 3** – Keep scrolling towards the bottom of the screen to find out ‘Windows Photo Viewer’. If ‘Windows Photo Viewer’ is visible, then it has been installed there and you can use it without any problem.
