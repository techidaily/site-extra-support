Professional level omnidirectional cameras are capable of covering the entire visual plane. While most professional cameras can have a range of 180°, Having 360° of vision insurance a full panoramic view. Virtual reality experiences can involve the use of VR devices whereby the user will control the angle of the shot. Online experiences are also making it easy to scroll around an image as the film is playing on screen. As users click and drag to the area that they want to see at given time, they can enjoy seeing every side of the shot in a full panoramic view. If you are a filmmaker that interested in finally creating some unique VR experiences or trying 360° cameras, it is important to work with the right tools.
