## Detailed Review: 20 Best Free Cloud Storage Services

Collaboration and sharing are now more accessible thanks to cloud storage. Fifty-three percent of people use cloud storage for file sharing, according to [**Reviews.com**](https://www.reviews.com/).

This is because they have some features that people may find confusing and are not particularly helpful. Task management and other features are provided expressly for businesses.

### No.5 Deego

Degoo is a cloud storage service that focuses heavily on consumers and is primarily concerned with photos and videos.

With only a web app available for the desktop, Degoo Cloud relies heavily on its apps for Android and iOS. There are also apps for Samsung and Huawei app. Although the service has few features, it's worth looking at if you need a place to store your photos.

Another service that ranks among our top-rated cloud storage services is MEGA, which, in large part, is due to its very generous free plan. It offers more free storage than any other excellent service on this list, with 20GB available without restrictions.

Most of these are straightforward tasks, like setting up the desktop and mobile apps and confirming your phone number for two-factor authentication. You will receive an additional 5GB of storage for each of these for 35GB. Additionally, you can invite friends for a fee of 5GB each.

**Official address**: <https://mega.io/>

Due to its extensive feature set, it takes the top spot on our short list of the best cloud backup services.

### No. 17\. LetsUpload

It enables you to stream media directly from your account, share files with anyone, set passwords for folders and files, send files via the built-in email feature, upload files by URL, and copy share links in bulk.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

## Detailed Review: 20 Best Free Cloud Storage Services

Collaboration and sharing are now more accessible thanks to cloud storage. Fifty-three percent of people use cloud storage for file sharing, according to [**Reviews.com**](https://www.reviews.com/). Businesses now use cloud storage instead of local storage drives. Many **cloud storage** providers only offer accounts to businesses. This is because they have some features that people may find confusing and are not particularly helpful. Task management and other features are provided expressly for businesses. Here is a compilation of the 20 **best free cloud storage** services:

### No.1 Userscloud.com

A free cloud service is available at userscloud.com. They offer limitless online storage and remote backup space in addition to cutting-edge uploading and downloading tools.

Userscloud.com is excellent for accessing personal data from various devices without carrying a USB stick. You can earn money on the website through referrals by[**clicking here**](https://userscloud.wordpress.com/).

Although the free plan has Unlimited upload and download, there are some conditions which are:

* The file expires after 24 hours with no downloads.
* Slow download speed

However, to avoid this, subscribe to a premium plan that costs $6.99.

### No. 15\. IDrive

IDrive is a hybrid solution that serves as a backup service rather than a cloud storage service. As we noted in our review of IDrive, in addition to allowing users to schedule automatic backups, IDrive also includes a sync folder, placing it on par with the other services on this list. Due to its extensive feature set, it takes the top spot on our short list of the best cloud backup services.

### No. 17\. LetsUpload

LetsUpload stands out from the other **1TB free cloud storage** providers on this list because it offers unlimited backup space free. It is much more than most websites offer, whether 10 GB, 1 TB, or 100 TB. You can save an almost unlimited amount in your account, but you won't miss out on any extraordinary features. It enables you to stream media directly from your account, share files with anyone, set passwords for folders and files, send files via the built-in email feature, upload files by URL, and copy share links in bulk.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** the maximum upload size, when the account becomes dormant, ads, FTP and torrent uploads support, and the amount of time you must wait between downloads are some differences between a free and premium account.

**Official address**: <https://letsupload.io/>

**Max free space**: Unlimited

### No. 20\. CBackup

CBackup is an effective method to acquire free unlimited cloud backup storage. This **free cloud storage** can connect multiple cloud storage service accounts. You can merge all available storage in these accounts into a more immense combined cloud, such as 100 gigabytes or unlimited storage space to back up your data. It only takes a few minutes to back up or sync data from one cloud storage account to another, and you can do either of those things directly. Using CBackup will be more cost-effective than a minor expensive cloud storage service because it offers professional backup methods and standard backup features.

**Max free space:** 10GB
