## Definition of 360° video

 Do you want to have your very own 360° video? Then there are a couple of things that you need to know. The first thing you need to know is that 360° videos can be rotated on the screen, effectively giving you a full view of what is around you. You can still play the video as it is happening and you will still be able to see all of the fine detail. There is no lag or delay and it is a great way for you to see whatever you want on the video without ruining the experience. All in all, if you think of a 360° photo and combine it with video, then you will start to understand how it all works. Of course, not all videos are 360° and there are some that cannot be done in this format, but it is a great way for you to truly make the viewer feel as though they are in the video themselves.

 Different from 360° video, when you take a look at [Virtual Reality video]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-vr-video.html) on the other hand, you will move the camera with your head or with the technology, instead of using a mouse on the screen.

## How does 360° video work?

 You simply take multiple cameras and you give them an overlapping field of view. You can then be given the chance to record a seamless 360x 180 view and degree field. There are plenty of compact video cameras out there that can offer you an incredible view with a very wide angle lens as well. A lot of Go Pro cameras can do this for you and it is a great way for you to get the result you want. Of course, at the end of the day, as long as you have a lot of cameras with a lot of overlapping fields of view, you will be able to transform your video into a 360° panoramic shot without compromising the experience for your user at all.

## How to create and upload 360° video?

 If you want to make your own 360°video then you will need a special set of cameras because you will need them all to record a 360° field of vision and you also need them to do this simultaneously. You can also edit the video to show what angle it starts to play at and what angles the viewer can see it from. Normally you would drag your curser around but if you have a mobile device then you can do it with your finger as well. Because all of the cameras are recording simultaneously, you will also find that the sound is recorded perfectly so you can play it alongside the video with flawless efficiency.

 So as you can see, it is more than easy enough for you to upload your video and you would be very surprised to see how easy it is for you to get started. You can shoot your video in the same time it would normally.

 So how do you go ahead and upload the video you want to social media? All you have to do is upload it. If you have shot the video correctly then social media will recognise this and the site you choose will automatically cater it to meet the needs of your audience. Of course, the most important thing that you need to do is make sure that your video is good quality. If your cameras are shooting in a lower level of quality then this can affect the whole experience and it really is something that you will want to avoid at all times. That being said, if the people who are going to be viewing your video have computers with a lower spec, or if they don’t have a solid internet connection then this will automatically lower the quality for them, but the people who do have better computers will still be able to view it in stunning 1080P.
