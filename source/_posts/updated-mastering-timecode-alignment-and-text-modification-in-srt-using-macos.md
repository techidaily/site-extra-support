## Part 1: Does the SRT file work on a Mac?

The SRT file is typically a plain text-based file with time markers, sequence numbers, and captions. Most third-party media players do showcase the SRT-based format easily. So, you can also use Preview apps or any other software to access and read the basic text documents on Mac.

However, the QuickTime player on Mac does not always support SRT in videos. You have to convert them to a format the QuickTime Player supports or utilize a third-party **SRT editor Mac** allows.

## Part 2: What Programs can open SRT Files on Mac, and How to do it?

Indeed, you have to install specific types of software on your Mac device if you want to **SRT edit Mac-**based videos. Specific programs support the SRT file in media files on Mac devices. You must use these tools separately to open and edit the SRT file.

### Method 1: Open SRT files on Mac using TextEdit

It is possible to use NotePad for viewing the **SRT Mac-based** files if they are planning to open the basic text-based SRT files. However, the alternative for Mac is called TextEdit, and it works similarly as the NotePad word-processing program.

**Features:**

* Simple user interface.
* Easy to create new SRT files.
* No major length-based limitations.
* Lightweight solution.

 Pros

* Easily accessible on the device.
* Pre-built utility.

![type in the editor timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-open-or-edit-srt-on-mac-1.jpg)

Step3 Add the starting and ending time codes with the following command. Press Enter again.

\[hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds ––> hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds\]

Step4 Insert the caption text and hit the Enter key twice. This will create a blank line for the second caption sequence- try to include two lines for each caption to reduce the amount of space it takes on the screen.

Continue the same steps for the next few caption sequences.

Step5 Click the Format tab > Make Plain Text. Alternatively, press the Shift + Command + T keys on the keyboard.

![click the format tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-open-or-edit-srt-on-mac-2.jpg)
