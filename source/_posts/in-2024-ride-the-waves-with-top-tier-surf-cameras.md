This highly durable camera unit serves with UHD 4K resolutions at 30fps so that breathtaking videos can be recorded. The TG tracker of this device needs separate casing for better protection whereas its shockproof body can serve you up to 98.4’ underwater with better protection. The ultra-wide lenses work at an angle of 204 degrees and remote monitors makes operations much easier for beginners as well as professionals.
