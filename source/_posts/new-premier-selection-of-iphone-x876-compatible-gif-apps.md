Luckily there are a lot of apps in the App Store you can use for free that allows you to create animated GIFs. What’s more, you can use these apps to convert live photos you’ve taken with your iPhone into GIFs and share them on non-Apple devices.

The only way to turn a series of photos into an animated GIF on the iPhone is to install a GIF creator app. Once you’ve gone through the installation process, you just have to upload the photos you want to include in the GIF, add text or apply visual effects and set the loop count value.
