## Part 2: Best video editors on M1 chip

We have tested and installed various video editors on Mac M1 and discovered that the native apps work much better. Editing raw footage has never been easier until the introduction of the M1 chip. However, not all video editors are compatible with it. We did some research to find out the three best video editors that will make your life significantly easier. Here's the kicker:

### 1\. Final Cut Pro

The intuitive app design makes it more beginner-friendly, and its compatibility with M1 chips enhances its speed six times.

The availability of third-party plug-ins is even better as it makes the app fitting for professional video editing.
