### 5\. Add Double Exposure

This technique is usually applied to merge two layers and exposures on a single image.

### 6\. Splash the Colors

Mixing and playing with the colors is another way to express the innovative imagination. Pixlr free photo editor provides this opportunity to the people who would like to intermix the colors in their photos.
