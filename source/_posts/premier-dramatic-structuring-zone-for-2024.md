![screenwriting.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-4.jpg)

John August, the author of Go, Charlie's Angels, and Big Fish has created one of the best online screenwriting websites for answering basic questions about the craft and business of writing.

Enter any question into the search bar and, nine times out of ten, you'll find an answer.

## Part 2\. Best 5 free websites to download scripts

When I want to see how a more seasoned or, let's be honest, a better writer than me attacks a story, I usually want to read their script. I want to know how they follow the story on the page and for that... I need to see the script.

But since I don't work in a studio, I must find them online and the search can be exhausting. So, what are the best websites for downloading movies and TV scripts?

Let's go through them together.

### 1\. [IMSDB– Internet Movie Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

This is the first place I go for scripted stuff. They have an extensive catalog and have proven to be a valuable resource for researching film crews, actors, and trivia. IMSDB is equally useful for those looking for screenplays of all kinds and genres, which they have listed in categories.

![imsdb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![go into the story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-6.jpg)

I'm a huge fan of Scott Myers. He gives everything to the writer. Go Into the Story is the official blog for The **_Black List,_** the screenwriting community known for its annual list of the top ten unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. There is always a bank of scripts that you can filter.

### 3\. [Simply Scripts](https://www.simplyscripts.com/)

### 5\. [The Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

![the screenplay database](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-9.jpg)

The script database is another useful resource with a large selection of scripts to choose from. If you're interested in a certain type of movie, the site also lets you search its library by genre, allowing you to browse the window displays and find something you didn't even know you were looking for.

Everyone seems to have advice about Hollywood, but who can you trust? John August is one of Hollywood's best screenwriters. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Big Fish and continues to work on major studio films such as Aladdin, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie's Angels.

![studiobinder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-12.jpg)

### 4\. [Internet Movie Script Database](https://imsdb.com/)

![internet movie script database](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-13.jpg)

If you're going to write screenplays for a career, you'd better get used to reading them. But professional scripts can be hard to find.

IMSDB is an extensive database of old and new works for you to browse. The website has new, old, and classic scripts for you to dissect and study.

### 5\. [The Black List](https://blcklst.com/)

![the black list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-14.jpg)

From the website, Blacklist is "...a closed network that connects script buyers, agents and screenwriters in one place". You can upload your script for a fee and then have users and readers rate it on a scale of 1-10\. It is a way to enter the digital age.

The Blacklist appropriated the term from the McCarthy era of the 1950s and has since become a place where industry figures vote on their favorite projects of the year.

It has since expanded to an online database where users can submit their scripts for coverage and be ranked among competitors.

## Part 4\. Make your scripts come true by using Filmora
