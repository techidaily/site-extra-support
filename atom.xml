That is about to change completely as Apple introduced the first Mac with a new <strong>Apple M1</strong> chip that uses ARM-64 bit architecture. It is Apple’s first custom silicon system on a chip that is being used in the new Macs. It was already being used in iPads and iPhones, and now it is being presented in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini.</p><h2 id="What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook"><a href="#What-does-the-M1-chip-mean-for-the-new-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?"></a>What does the M1 chip mean for the new MacBook?</h2><p>The instruction set that is being used by the ARM technology is much more simplified than x86, thus, making it more energy-efficient. Up until today, Macs used Intel processors which had multiple chips for I&#x2F;O, processor, security, and memory. The M1 chip unlike the Intel processors has combined all these chips into a single system on chip or SoC. This makes it more simple, efficient, and better at performance.</p><p>M1 is also the first personal computer chip built with 5-nanometer process technology. Apple has managed to fit 16,000,000,000 transistors in a single M1 chip, which is more than any chip ever invented for personal computers.</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>The CPU consists of 8 cores with 4 of them being high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. These cores can work alone unless they are needed to do high-performance tasks, in which case all 8 cores can work together. This technology makes at least 3.9 times faster than its Intel counterpart and gives the MacBook an amazing 20-hour playback on battery time.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU</strong></li></ul><p>The GPU is an eight-core integrated chip with 2.6 teraflops of raw power output. The performance tests have revealed that running around 25,000 threads concurrently gives it a better performance than the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.</p><p>Normally, PCs need a separate chip for graphics performance, but Apple’s new integrated GPU gives it a huge performance edge with minimum power consumption. According to apple, it is the world’s fastest integrated graphics in a PC.</p><ul><li><strong>Neural Engine</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s latest neural engine has a 16-core design which enables it to execute 11 trillion operations per second. This means that video editors can frame a click intelligently and instantly. Apart from that, the software can make the details better and sharper in no time. The new neural engine gives apple 15x faster machine learning capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/apple-m1.jpg"                      alt="apple m1 chip"                ></p><h2 id="Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors"><a href="#Apple-M1-compared-to-Intel-Processors" class="headerlink" title="Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors"></a>Apple M1 compared to Intel Processors</h2><p>The new Apple M1 chip is proving to be better than its old Intel base models. Here are a few comparisons:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>Apple M1</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i7</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core-i9</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>3.2 GHz</td><td>2.6 GHz</td><td>5.3 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cores</strong></td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (1 Core)</td><td>None</td><td>5.10 GHz</td><td>5.00 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turbo</strong> (All Cores)</td><td></td><td>3.20 GHz</td><td>4.70 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Core Architecture</strong></td><td>Hybrid (big. LITTLE)</td><td>Normal</td><td>Normal</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i7</strong></li></ul><p>Apple M1 beats the Intel i7 speed by 2.8 times according to Apple. The graphics are significantly better and all that with the minimum usage of power. Apple claims that the battery can last up to 20 hours.</p><p>According to a test between the new Apple Macbook with M1 chip vs Dell XPS 13 with 11th gen core-i7, the M1 performed way better than i7. The first test was opening 50 apps simultaneously which apple won by a huge margin. While the M1 chip was able to open and run all the apps within a matter of seconds, the Dell XPS took its time to open those apps and once it did, they were unable to run. Apart from all that, the M1 fan was working efficiently and silently while Dell had overheated and almost hanged.</p><p>When it came to testing the battery life, after 4 hours of intense gaming the Dell had a 7% battery left. The Macbook with M1 was still running at 30%. In benchmark performances, on single-core The M1 was 7% faster yet on multiple cores, the M1 was a whopping 63% faster than i7.</p><p>There is also a $300 price difference between the two with Apple Macbook being the cheaper one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i7.png"                      alt="Intel i7"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Apple M1 VS Intel Core-i9</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to specifications the i9 takes a little of upper-hand in performance, but they also come in much more expensive PCs. Now even with all that, the most surprising aspect was that on Geekbench 5, the Apple M1 still outperformed the i9 on single-core by 23%; however, on multiple cores, the i9 was 19% faster than the new M1.</p><p>Keeping all that in mind, the M1 might still need to catch-up to the i9, but it certainly poses a huge threat for Intel as this is just Apple’s first experiment. One factor that also makes the i9 perform better is that it allows up to 128 GB of memory while the M1 only comes with 8 GB and 16 GB variants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/Intel-i9.png"                      alt="Intel i9"                ></p><h2 id="What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips"><a href="#What-about-the-Apple-computers-with-Intel-Chips" class="headerlink" title="What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?"></a>What about the Apple computers with Intel Chips?</h2><p>The new M1 chip is only available in a limited number of systems as of now and Apple will still be making its PCs using the Intel chip. You’ll now have the option to choose either the M1 variant or the one with an Intel processor. Apple will however move towards installing the M1 chip in all of its Macs if the experiment goes well.</p><h2 id="Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing"><a href="#Is-the-M1-Chip-Good-for-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?"></a>Is the M1 Chip Good for Video Editing?</h2><p>Definitely yes! The performance of M1 Chip on video editing is quite impressive. It can edit multiple 4-8K videos smoothly, and the rendering is faster than Intel. What you can’t say no to it - it is truly efficient. After conducting several editing tasks, there is still plenty of battery life. The only flaw would be if the video editor does not run natively on the M1 chip, you would not experience that much difference.</p><p><strong>Learn More:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Which Video Editor Works on M1 Chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has launched the M1 technology that has broken all the barriers of innovation in the personal computer world. It has recently been launched only on MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook mini, but it is just a test phase which apple is nailing by the way.</p><p>This is the first integrated chip for a personal computer that combines I&#x2F;O, GPU, CPU, and memory together. Compared with its Intel counterparts, the M1 outperforms them by a huge margin. With 16 billion transistors and the highest CPU performance per watt, Apple has outdone itself with its new technology. Although it may have a few drawbacks it is quite new in the market and even in its initial phase, the M1 looks exceedingly promising.</p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to claim this achievement as the setting stone for a new world of technology when it comes to personal computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagram-share-of-todays-thought-provoking-talk/"><u>2024 Approved  Instagram Share of Today's Thought-Provoking Talk</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-picture-perfect-presentation-software-for-impeccable-photo-framing/"><u>2024 Approved  Picture Perfect Presentation  Software for Impeccable Photo Framing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-peak-business-sky-storage-for-firms/"><u>[New] Peak Business Sky-Storage for Firms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-lullabies-on-a-screen-analysis-of-story-tapes-for-sleep/"><u>In 2024, Lullabies on a Screen  Analysis of Story Tapes for Sleep</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-spectaculous-14-animated-text-illustration-samples/"><u>2024 Approved  Spectaculous 14 Animated Text Illustration Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-light-the-way-three-no-fail-iphone-video-brilliance-hacks/"><u>In 2024, Light the Way  Three No-Fail iPhone Video Brilliance Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-storytellers-supreme-curated-yt-channels/"><u>[Updated] Storytellers Supreme  Curated YT Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-solving-isolated-sound-issue/"><u>[Updated] Solving Isolated Sound Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-13-best-ways-to-make-money-on-reddit-no-experience-needed/"><u>In 2024, 13 Best Ways to Make Money on Reddit - No Experience Needed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-expertly-broadcast-your-gopro-adventures-on-top-channels-periscope-facebook/"><u>[Updated] Expertly Broadcast Your Gopro Adventures on Top Channels (Periscope, Facebook)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-motorola-razr-40-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data After Switching From Motorola Razr 40 to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/1713948840404-as-an-online-marketer-it-is-important-to-know-the-algorithm-of-youtube-platform-ill-share-you-the-history-of-algorithm-of-youtube-and-the-new-changes-in-thi/"><u>As an Online Marketer, It Is Important to Know the Algorithm of YouTube Platform.

It is a term used in old times when there were no advanced technology and printers were typed by small sticks called typewriters. It helps the viewer to understand the actions of the specific character.</p><h3 id="The-Function-of-slug-line"><a href="#The-Function-of-slug-line" class="headerlink" title="The Function of slug line"></a>The Function of slug line</h3><p>The main heading scene is responsible for starting an enthusiasm in the background. Slug lines establish the main scene properly. These are the scripts used to break up the length of a scene and can also be used to create pace in different types of scenes.

When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the “audience” can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li></ol><p>The determination of time is also a basic format.

It is a term used in old times when there were no advanced technology and printers were typed by small sticks called typewriters. It helps the viewer to understand the actions of the specific character.</p><h3 id="The-Function-of-slug-line-1"><a href="#The-Function-of-slug-line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Function of slug line"></a>The Function of slug line</h3><p>The main heading scene is responsible for starting an enthusiasm in the background.

Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the “audience” can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.</p><ol><li><strong>Time</strong></li></ol><p>The determination of time is also a basic format.

You can use an <strong>offline speech to text</strong> converter to add subtitles and captions to your video or dictate texts on NotePad, Word, and other text editors. So, whether you want to add subtitles or dictate texts, consider using these five voice recognition services.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-5-STT-Services-You-Can-Use-Offline"><a href="#Part-1-Best-5-STT-Services-You-Can-Use-Offline" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best 5 STT Services You Can Use Offline"></a>Part 1: Best 5 STT Services You Can Use Offline</h2><p>Let’s quickly discuss the best offline speech to text converters. Of course, this rules out cloud-based services like Google Cloud.</p><ol><li><strong>Windows Speech Recognition – Free&#x2F;Inbuilt</strong></li></ol><p>If you’re using a Windows 10&#x2F;11, you don’t necessarily need to install a speech-to-text program, as the OS comes baked with a voice recognition service. It’s free to use and allows users to dictate texts into documents, chats, and other windows. All you need is a connected microphone and start dictating texts.</p><p>Interestingly, you can dictate texts in multiple languages using Windows Speech Recognition. It supports Spanish, English, Chinese, German, French, and Japanese. You can even train your PC to recognize your voice commands.</p><p>Let’s take a look!</p><p>Step1First, you’ll need to enable the STT feature on your PC. To do that, plug in your microphone before searching and click “Speech Settings.” Now tap “Get Started” and follow the instructions to set up the speech recognition service.</p><p>Step2Open an app that accepts texts. This can be Microsoft Word, Notepad, search box, and more. Then, click the Win + H shortcut to launch the STT tool on top of the window.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts. You can use commands such as new line, no space, select word, select all, colon, semi-colon, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-service-offline-1.jpg"                      alt="speech to text service offline on windows"                ></p><ol><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora 11</strong></a> <strong>– Free (with watermark)&#x2F;$49.99&#x2F;year</strong> [need network connection]</li></ol><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows operating systems. In fact, you’ll be surprised that the full version only costs $49.99&#x2F;year. That said, Filmora 11 comes with a full-fledged SST service that’s quick and super accurate. It uses Artificial Intelligence to auto-detect voices before transcribing them to editable texts.</p><p>Speaking of text editing, this speech to text converter allows you to customize the text to your preference. You can copy, delete, duplicate, and change the playback duration. And after extracting texts, you can download them to SRT format. Remember, Filmora 11 supports 16+ transcription languages.</p><p>Steps to convert speech to text with Filmora 11:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Step1Launch Wondershare Filmora 11 on your PC and then start a <strong>New Project</strong>.

Moreover, you can dictate any text length.</p><p>Follow me:</p><p>Step1To begin using Mac’s inbuilt STT feature, you first have to enable it. Click Apple &gt; System Preference &gt; Keyboard &gt; Dictation. Tap On and then click Enable Dictation. You can also choose a dictation language beforehand.</p><p>Step2Open a text editor on your MacBook and press the Microphone icon on the function keys row. When the active Microphone symbol appears, start dictating your text. Like the Windows versions, Mac’s STT feature supports multiple voice commands.</p><p>Step3After dictating enough content, open the dictation keyboard shortcut and click Done. All unrecognized texts will be underlined in blue.</p><ol><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe&hl=en&gl=US"><strong>Live Transcribe &amp; notification</strong></a> <strong>- Free</strong></li></ol><p>We can’t wrap up this list without reserving a spot for at least one audio-to-text service for Android. With Live Transcribe &amp; notification app, you can transcribe speech in English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Japanese. It’s a reasonably easy-to-use app. Just allow microphone permission and transcribe texts. You can also adjust the text size.</p><p>Below are the quick steps:</p><p>Step1Install and run Live Transcribe &amp; Notification on your Android phone.</p><p>Step2Go to your device settings and permit the app to access your microphone. If successful, the app will tell you, “Ready to transcribe.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-service-offline-8.jpg"                      alt="speech to text service offline for android"                ></p><p>Step3Lastly, dictate your text, and you’ll see the text on your mobile screen. Copy the transcribed text to your clipboard and paste it elsewhere.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Transcribe-STT-Often-Used-Online"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Transcribe-STT-Often-Used-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is Transcribe STT Often Used Online?"></a>Part 2: Why is Transcribe STT Often Used Online?</h2><p>Up to this point, we’ve discussed the best offline speech to text converters. In other words, you don’t need any internet connection to transcribe audio with these programs. But one thing is sure; there are countless audio-to-text converters out there. So, why do most people prefer to use online speech to text converters?</p><p>First, online transcription services are free and straightforward to use. In most cases, you don’t need to register or pay anything to transcribe texts. Just upload your audio or connect a microphone and start dictating or converting. After conversion, these apps will often let you copy and use the text anywhere on your device.</p><p>Another reason why online STTs are attractive is that you don’t need to install anything to transcribe audio. While macOS and Windows systems come with their inbuilt STT services, these tools can only work with text dictation. In other words, you can’t upload local audio and transcribe it. So, if you’re in a hurry to convert audio to text, use the online converters.</p><p>But don’t be so quick to dismiss the offline STT versions. You may need to convert a long audio into text often. Now, if you’re using an online tool, you’ll most likely get a text limit. On the other hand, offline tools allow you to dictate or transcribe unlimited audio durations. And without forgetting that you don’t need any internet connection to do that.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Speech-to-Text-Service-Offline"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Speech-to-Text-Service-Offline" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Mac computers come with their own inbuilt voice recognition services. It’s a keyboard dictation feature for dictating texts anywhere on your computer. You can dictate documents, messages, texts, search queries, and more.</p><p>In addition, it supports a host of dictation languages, and you don’t need an internet connection to use it. Moreover, you can dictate any text length.</p><p>Follow me:</p><p>Step1To begin using Mac’s inbuilt STT feature, you first have to enable it. Click Apple &gt; System Preference &gt; Keyboard &gt; Dictation. Tap On and then click Enable Dictation. You can also choose a dictation language beforehand.</p><p>Step2Open a text editor on your MacBook and press the Microphone icon on the function keys row. When the active Microphone symbol appears, start dictating your text. Like the Windows versions, Mac’s STT feature supports multiple voice commands.</p><p>Step3After dictating enough content, open the dictation keyboard shortcut and click Done. All unrecognized texts will be underlined in blue.</p><ol><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe&hl=en&gl=US"><strong>Live Transcribe &amp; notification</strong></a> <strong>- Free</strong></li></ol><p>We can’t wrap up this list without reserving a spot for at least one audio-to-text service for Android.

In other words, you don’t need any internet connection to transcribe audio with these programs. But one thing is sure; there are countless audio-to-text converters out there. So, why do most people prefer to use online speech to text converters?</p><p>First, online transcription services are free and straightforward to use. In most cases, you don’t need to register or pay anything to transcribe texts. Just upload your audio or connect a microphone and start dictating or converting. After conversion, these apps will often let you copy and use the text anywhere on your device.</p><p>Another reason why online STTs are attractive is that you don’t need to install anything to transcribe audio. While macOS and Windows systems come with their inbuilt STT services, these tools can only work with text dictation. In other words, you can’t upload local audio and transcribe it. So, if you’re in a hurry to convert audio to text, use the online converters.</p><p>But don’t be so quick to dismiss the offline STT versions. You may need to convert a long audio into text often. Now, if you’re using an online tool, you’ll most likely get a text limit. On the other hand, offline tools allow you to dictate or transcribe unlimited audio durations. And without forgetting that you don’t need any internet connection to do that.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Speech-to-Text-Service-Offline-1"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Speech-to-Text-Service-Offline-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

But, in pictures, mosaics are digital images where the tiles are replaced by smaller images.</p><p>Making mosaic collages aren’t that hard once you have discovered the right <strong>mosaic collage maker</strong>. After that, it’s all a matter of selecting the right pictures.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Types of Photo Mosaic Collage](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [How Do You Make a Mosaic Collage?](#Part 2)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Photo-Mosaic-Collage-3"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Photo-Mosaic-Collage-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Types of Photo Mosaic Collage"></a>Part 1 Types of Photo Mosaic Collage</h2><p>The art of mosaic has been around for a while and is now slowly making its digital transition into photomosaic art. There are various types of <strong>photo mosaics</strong> out there but not all of them can seem appealing to first-timers. Some of them are quite distinct while others are harder to recognize.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Individual Photos:</strong> Usually, individual photos and portraits can look amazing as a photo mosaic. The chaotic effect it has on an image can be quite aesthetic. They are easier to create and gorgeous to look at.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Landscape Photos</strong>: Landscapes are more complex. They involve a multitude of different colors it can get harder to match. Then again you can experiment with its multiple possibilities.</p><p>You can also categorize mosaic pictures according to how complicated it is to segregate the images within the collage. In these terms, there are two types of photomosaic collages;</p><h3 id="01Single-Color-Composition-3"><a href="#01Single-Color-Composition-3" class="headerlink" title="01Single Color Composition"></a>01Single Color Composition</h3><p>Each specific zone or portion of the target image is narrowed down to a few average colors. All images in your gallery are scanned to match a color that suits any single shortlisted color. These images are then placed in the place of the pixels whose color matches that of the pictures.</p><h3 id="02Advanced-Composition-3"><a href="#02Advanced-Composition-3" class="headerlink" title="02Advanced Composition"></a>02Advanced Composition</h3><p>A more advanced approach to photographic mosaics is when the matching is done pixel by pixel and the library images are then placed after much scrutiny.

They offer a visual guide to creating delicious menu items that range from delicious entrees to kid-friendly snacks.</p><p>If you would like to create some of these food videos yourself, this article will help you shoot the most appealing food videos possible.</p><h2 id="5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Shooting-Food-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos"></a>5 Tips for Shooting Food Videos</h2><h4 id="1-Light"><a href="#1-Light" class="headerlink" title="1. Light"></a>1. Light</h4><p>Light is one of the most crucial factors for your video. If the lighting is too bright, your food videography will appear washed out. If the lighting is too dark, food will appear shadowed and hard to see. Neither is a good option, because it does not present a very professional product.</p><p>The best to use is natural lighting. You want a lot of bright natural light, but not streaming directly through your windows as this creates shadows.</p><p>If the kitchen doesn’t work well for you, experiment with other rooms or outside, but be sure to keep furniture and clutter out of your shots.</p><h4 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio"></a>2. Audio</h4><p>Audio is one of the main components that sets <a class="link"   href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/visiting-seefood-media-food-videography/" >food videography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apart from food photography. There are two viable options. You can either set your video to music, which will help set the tone for your frame speed, or you can use a voice over to provide audible descriptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG"                      alt="audio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story"><a href="#3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="3. Try to Tell a Story"></a>3. Try to Tell a Story</h4><p>What seems like an insignificant change can be monumental. When crafting recipe videos, you want to try telling a story.</p><p>For example, instead of showing a mixer you could show a mother helping her child to mix the ingredients together. At the end of the clip, you could either show only the food, or you could show a man walking past the window with his dog in tow.</p><p>Telling a story will help to pull watchers into your video so they watch through until the end. It’s all about making viewers as invested as possible in a very short time frame.</p><p>If you don’t start pulling them in, such as by telling a story, in the first twenty seconds, they probably won’t continue watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-sell-a-story.JPG"                      alt="food"                ></p><h4 id="4-Video-Editing"><a href="#4-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Editing"></a>4. Video Editing</h4><p>Once the video is shot, you’ll have to do some post-production work. In other words, you need to edit your video. This is more time consuming than with food photography, because you must edit by frame, place to music, add title frames, and so on.</p><p>One major mistake people make with their food videos is the use of too many transitions or cut-scenes, such as fading, zoom outs, etc.</p><p>The best way to edit your videos is for quality, with a minimum of 90-97% straight shots – meaning no transitions are used.</p><h4 id="5-Decoration"><a href="#5-Decoration" class="headerlink" title="5. Decoration"></a>5. Decoration</h4><p>Some people will choose to shoot their videos using bold, bright colors in their food and setting.</p><p>Others may decide that a simple setting – such as a classic wooden table with nothing more than a small flower vase – is more suitable for the dish they are creating.</p><p>Both are great choices, but the key is to base your settings off your dish, ensuring the area surrounding the food is complementary and not contrasting.</p><p>Videographers may choose to use other techniques to make the final dish pop.</p><p>This could include food carving, plating techniques, or even just the use of high-tech equipment which has the potential to capture even the tiniest food fragment in vivid detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-decoration.JPG"                      alt="decoration food"                ></p><h2 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h2><h4 id="1-Smart-Phone"><a href="#1-Smart-Phone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smart Phone"></a>1. Smart Phone</h4><p>One way to shoot food videos is with your smart phone. To do this, use the built-in camera feature set to take video in landscape mode (this looks the best).</p><p>Hold very still to prevent shaking, and simply hold the screen for autofocus and exposure prior to beginning your film.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="smart phone"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lens"><a href="#2-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens"></a>2. Lens</h4><p>If you are going to shoot with a camera, you need either a mirrorless camera or DSLR. A standard click-and-shoot will not provide a high enough quality of video. Along with a high-quality camera comes the need for a high-quality lens.</p><p>The lens you shoot with should be able to zoom in or out on the food.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-by-Step-for-Gaining-Access-to-the-Best-Clip-Art"><a href="#Step-by-Step-for-Gaining-Access-to-the-Best-Clip-Art" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step for Gaining Access to the Best Clip Art"></a>Step by Step for Gaining Access to the Best Clip Art</h2><p>As a professional website builder, you should know the importance of <strong>photo clip art</strong>. Clip arts help create illustrations and backgrounds, giving customers a positive first impression. But getting the perfect clip art is a different story altogether. You might need to hire a quality photographer, who may set you back good money. But thankfully, you can download <strong>royalty-free clipart</strong> from hundreds of websites if you don’t have the time or money to hire a photographer. So, in this article, we want to discuss the best websites to get high-quality copyright-free clipart. But first, let’s discuss what clipart is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Clip-Art"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Clip-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Clip Art?"></a>Part 1: What is Clip Art?</h2><p>Clip art might sound alien to you if you’re still new to photography and website building. Well, clipart or clip art is simply a graphic image made using pre-made photos. Typically, clipart is used for illustrations on printed or electronic media. Besides websites, you can also find clip art on infographics, mobile applications, trademarks, logos, and more.</p><p>But why use clip art instead of traditional photos on your website? The thing is that clip arts look more cartoonish. This gives them a more universal feel on whatever website you’re working on. In addition, clip art will seamlessly fit inside your texts because they don’t have rigid triangular frames like stock photos. Of course, this can make your page more interesting.</p><p>In the meantime, clip art can come in numerous file formats but is divided into two categories. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>Vector graphics</strong>: Vector graphics are images generated directly from geometrical shapes. Because of this, vector graphics give more explicit clip art than traditional photos. In fact, vector illustrations can be printed or processed at the highest resolution without losing the original quality. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is the most used vector graphic format on HTML5 browsers like Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera.</li><li><strong>Bitmap:</strong> Bitmap is a raster image for creating website designs. BMP images provide smooth color transitions with a wide array of shades. Just think of it as a mosaic which uses a close set of materials or stone. However, bitmaps have limited resolution quality, leading to blurry or grainy results after printing. The most common bitmap formats you can use on your website project include JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.</li></ul><p>It is also worth noting that clip art images are governed by usage or copyright acts. The most common rights include royalty-free, rights managed, and <strong>public domain clip art</strong>. So, in this guidepost, we’ll focus on where to get a public domain and royalty-free clip arts, which are available to use without paying licensing fees.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Sites-with-Public-Domain-Clip-Art"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Sites-with-Public-Domain-Clip-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Sites with Public Domain Clip Art"></a>Part 2: Best Sites with Public Domain Clip Art</h2><p>A public domain image is clip art that never had any copyright in the first place.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Jovial-Access-Key-Strategies"><a href="#Jovial-Access-Key-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Jovial Access Key Strategies"></a>Jovial Access Key Strategies</h2><p>Today, it seems that there are no individuals who have not heard about Funimate, a true 2022 phenomenon among video-sharing smartphone applications.

This application became very famous among US teenagers, and then everyone began talking about it all around the globe.</p><p>Apps such as Funimate allow for video editing on mobile devices.

Funimate also has an effects mix tool that includes 100 complex video effects. You may also utilize the effects for the intro and outro.

When you first use the app, you will be provided with two options: “Create an Account” and “Login.” Users must have an email, Facebook, or Twitter account, as well as a Google Play or iTunes account, to register.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-funimate-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="download funimate"                ></p><p>Step 2: To enjoy the free trial, you must click “Subscribe,” and they will be alerted immediately that a payment has been made. Although the app’s terms of service specify that users must be 13 to register for an account, there is no age verification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-account-funimate.jpg"                      alt="create account funimate"                ></p><p>Step 3: Before you continue, be sure to read the “Terms of Use” and “Privacy Policy” on the official website, since this might have serious consequences.</p><p>Step 4: Clicking “Create an Account” will take you to the next screen. If you have already registered, it will display “Email Address already registered.” In this scenario, you must utilize the lost password option to regain access to your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sign-up-funimate.jpg"                      alt="sign up funimate"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-for-Logging-in-to-Funimate"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-for-Logging-in-to-Funimate" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps for Logging in to Funimate"></a>Part 2: Steps for Logging in to Funimate</h2><p>Users begin by establishing a profile, which may be done by linking a social network account or by entering their phone number. They may look for and follow other people after creating a profile.

Add some additional effects to your photographs and videos to make them seem better. Unlocking hidden effects from a reputable app, on the other hand, is a piece of cake. Let’s get right into it:</p><p><strong>Steps to Get Featured Pack of Funimate</strong></p><p>Step 1: Visit the Google Play and App Stores. Now look for the Funimate App. After that, download and install the most recent version of the Funimate App on your Android and iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate-app-android.jpg"                      alt="funimate app android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, navigate to your profile and then touch on the Settings symbol in the upper right corner.

As a result, you may effortlessly modify your films with fantastic effects.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Edit-Your-Funimate-Account"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Edit-Your-Funimate-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Edit Your Funimate Account"></a>Part 4: How to Edit Your Funimate Account</h2><p>Funimate may be used to create a slideshow of photographs with text art and dynamic text. Users may use this application to edit their movies by trimming, cutting, cropping, merging, duplicating, collaging, and looping clips. Users may also use features to blur, vary the pace, fade in and out, animate text, add GIFs, and include music to their films. However, if you’ve been using Funimate for a time, it’s not uncommon to decide to modify one or both. Perhaps you used your actual name and were unaware that it would be made public. Perhaps the name you initially picked is no longer appropriate for the sort of material you want to publish. Or maybe you’ve just decided that you’d rather be known by something more intriguing.</p><p><strong>Step to Edit Free Funimate Pro Account</strong></p><p>Step 1: Launch the Funimate app and choose the Profile option in the lower right corner of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-funimate-app.jpg"                      alt="launch funimate"                ></p><p>Step 2: Choose Shoot a Video or Edit to update your feed and for the profile name, go to the sign up step to enter your new name here. In the case of your username, keep in mind that it must be unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shoot-a-video-funimate.jpg"                      alt="shoot a video funimate"                ></p><p>Step 3: Navigate to your profile page on the Funimate app. Tap on the ‘Profile’ icon in the bottom right-hand corner to view your profile. After all, your social media profile photo is part of how you promote yourself to the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/profile-in-funimate.jpg"                      alt="profile in funimate"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose one of the choices shown in the popup window. You may upload a picture, snap a new one, or just examine your existing photo and crop it again to improve it.</p><p>Step 5: Whether you want more followers or want people to understand your content area better, you should describe it in your bio. This is a short tagline that informs other users about what they can anticipate from your Funimate account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tagline-in-funimate.jpg"                      alt="tagline in funimate"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With the proper privacy settings, Funimate is suitable for adult adolescent users. By default, Funimate profiles are set to public, however, they may be changed to private. Having a private account is significantly safer for children, particularly if they wish to make videos of themselves. Users may opt to make individual videos private if they wish to have a public profile. A full profile page is an excellent method to persuade people to follow you on Funimate. However, to remain current, you need to update it regularly. Just be cautious not to make too many changes, since this may make it difficult for your followers to keep up.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate"></a>Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate</h2><p>The application populates user profiles with followers who must be actively unfollowed, but it also provides users with many privacy settings, such as the ability to make their accounts private, restrict comments and collaborations, and block other users from sharing their videos.

After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

It’s time to stop wasting time and money on ineffective videos that don’t get results. If you follow the tips below, you’ll have a solid strategy for creating professional-looking testimonial videos that your customers will love and share.</p><h2 id="Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer"><a href="#Identify-Your-Perfect-Customer" class="headerlink" title="Identify Your Perfect Customer"></a>Identify Your Perfect Customer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/identify-your-perfect-customer.jpg"                      alt="identify your perfect customer"                ></p><p>The first key tactic to creating a perfect testimonial video is identifying your perfect customer. The more you know about the type of person who will benefit the most from using your product or service, the better you can tailor your video content to speak directly to them.</p><p>It may seem like a daunting task, but there are several ways you can go about defining who this person is:</p><ul><li>If possible, talk with current customers and ask them what they love about their experience with your business.</li><li>If that’s not an option for some reason (maybe there aren’t any current customers), consider hiring a research firm or marketing agency that specializes in surveying potential customers and asking questions like “What would encourage you to buy from us?” or “How could we improve our service?” With this information in hand, it should be easier than ever before!</li></ul><h2 id="Ask-Authentic-Questions"><a href="#Ask-Authentic-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Ask Authentic Questions"></a>Ask Authentic Questions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ask-authentic-questions.jpg"                      alt="ask authentic questions"                ></p><ul><li>Open-ended questions are the best way to engage customers and get them to speak naturally.</li><li>Make your question relevant to the customer and your product or service.</li><li>The more specific you can be with these questions, the better. For example, if you’re selling pet products online, ask about their pets’ names, breed, and color (if applicable).</li><li>If there’s no good reason for asking a question then don’t! For example: “How was your experience with our website?”</li></ul><h2 id="Include-Strong-Opinions"><a href="#Include-Strong-Opinions" class="headerlink" title="Include Strong Opinions"></a>Include Strong Opinions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/include-strong-opinion.jpg"                      alt="include strong opinion"                ></p><ul><li>Use the word “I”.</li><li>Use the word “we”.</li><li>Use the word “you”.</li><li>You can also use the word “they” for an authoritative tone, or “them”, which is more casual and vaguer, depending on what you want to convey.</li><li>Please avoid saying the word “me” because this makes it sound like you’re speaking in the third person—which can come across as unnatural and pretentious.</li></ul><h2 id="Keep-it-All-Short-and-Sweet"><a href="#Keep-it-All-Short-and-Sweet" class="headerlink" title="Keep it All Short and Sweet"></a>Keep it All Short and Sweet</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keep-video-short-and-sweet.jpg"                      alt="keep video short and sweet"                ></p><p>When creating your video testimonial, you want to keep it short and sweet. After all, that’s the point of using video testimonials in the first place! Make sure you have a tight script with a few specific questions written down. You should also plan out how you’re going to arrange these questions into a flow.</p><p>When asking someone for their thoughts on a topic or issue, there’s always going to be some variation in how people respond. Some will talk about personal experiences; others will talk about what they’ve learned from others’ experiences; still, others might share some advice for future generations who might encounter similar problems. The key here is that your main objective is not necessarily the information itself (though this can help), but rather the emotion behind it—what effect does this experience have on your audience?</p><p>Asking open-ended questions allows people greater freedom when responding—and while this may sound like an ideal situation when creating content, it often results in less-than-ideal responses when creating content at scale since you won’t always get exactly what you want out of every shot.</p><h2 id="Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter"><a href="#Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter"></a>Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/lighting-sound-video-quality.jpg"                      alt="lighting sound video quality"                ></p><p>Lighting, sound, and video quality matter.</p><p>This is a given. If you want your testimonial videos to be effective and believable, they need to be properly lit, recorded with good audio quality, and captured in high resolution.

While Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology used to be prone to errors that needed correcting later, it has advanced considerably in recent years and is now among the best in the business.</p><p>Whether you have the best Windows laptop or Mac—Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text is simple to discover and use. You’ll find all you need to know about connecting your microphone and inserting punctuation in this manual, from the first steps to the more complex aspects.</p><p>Here’s how to use Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Top Recommendation: Wondershare Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Evernote Speech-To-Text</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Google Docs Speech-To-Text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Speech-to-Text-in-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word?</h2><p>Before you can use Speech to Text in Microsoft Word, the first thing you need is a valid Microsoft 365 subscription. Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device. Name your document and save it on the desktop or wherever you like it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-1.jpg"                      alt="open microsoft word"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button"><a href="#Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button" class="headerlink" title="Step2Click on the Dictate button"></a>Step2Click on the Dictate button</h5><p>When you first open a new document, go to the top right corner of the Home menu includes a Dictate button and a drop-down menu. It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent. We can honestly state that Microsoft has the most refined product when it comes to cost vs performance because the software is integrated directly into Microsoft 365, which many businesses already use. So if your company uses Microsoft 365, you may start utilizing the voice typing technology right now with no additional expenses.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT"><a href="#Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT"></a>Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT</h2><p>There are some great alternative options to Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature.

Without a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft won’t allow you to use voice typing. However, if you’re working for a company, it’s likely that your company already has a Microsoft 365 enterprise subscription. If you’re a student or your company doesn’t offer it, the subscription plans are pretty affordable. For example, Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans cost $6.99&#x2F;month and $9.99&#x2F;month, respectively.</p><p>The second thing you need is a dependable internet connection. The reason is Microsoft Word’s dictation software works on remote servers to interpret your words. These enormous servers and lightning-fast processors require a large amount of speech data to transcribe your text. In reality, the program uses sophisticated neural networks and deep machine learning technology to ensure that it understands the nuances of human speech. These two technologies have helped voice typing technology evolve rapidly in recent years, which is why an internet connection is necessary.</p><p>Now let’s start typing:</p><h5 id="Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1"><a href="#Step1Open-Microsoft-Word-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Open Microsoft Word"></a>Step1Open Microsoft Word</h5><p>Create a new, empty document in Microsoft Word on your device. Name your document and save it on the desktop or wherever you like it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-1.jpg"                      alt="open microsoft word"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button-1"><a href="#Step2Click-on-the-Dictate-button-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Click on the Dictate button"></a>Step2Click on the Dictate button</h5><p>When you first open a new document, go to the top right corner of the Home menu includes a Dictate button and a drop-down menu. It has a microphone symbol above it. Double-check that the language is set to English using the drop-down menu. Choose English or any of the supported languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-2.jpg"                      alt="click on the dictate button"                ></p><p>Microsoft Word Speech to Text tool supports many languages as well languages that have multiple variants, such as English and French. In addition, you can type on Microsoft Word in Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Taiwanese), English, French (France, Canada), German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Mexico, Spain), Thai, and more.</p><h5 id="Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1"><a href="#Step3Allow-Microsoft-Word-Access-to-the-Microphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone"></a>Step3Allow Microsoft Word Access to the Microphone</h5><p>If you’ve never used Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text engine on Windows PC before, you’ll need to allow the program access to your microphone. This may be completed with a single click when prompted. You can use your laptop’s built-in microphone or connect an external one. But, we suggest you use an external microphone for improved accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-3.jpg"                      alt="allow microsoft word access to the microphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-4.jpg"                      alt="use speech to text"                ></p><p>Follow these steps to activate the microphone in Mac.</p><p>To turn voice dictation on or off:</p><ul><li>Select Apple &gt; System Preferences</li><li>Select View &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</li><li>Click ON to enable Dictation or OFF to disable it</li></ul><h5 id="Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1"><a href="#Step4Start-Dictating-Your-Document-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Start Dictating Your Document"></a>Step4Start Dictating Your Document</h5><p>Once again, click the dictate button after completing all the preceding steps. The blue symbol will vanish, and a red recording symbol will appear, signifying that Microsoft Word has begun listening for your voice. A chime will sound if your sound is turned up, indicating that transcription has started. Say the words you want Microsoft to transcribe out loud. It may seem odd at first, but after a while, you’ll get a flow going, and everyone will find their own method for getting the most out of the program. To stop the recording, click on the microphone button again or press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard. This will show the Stop Dictation dialogue box. From here, you can either save or cancel your work.</p><h5 id="Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1"><a href="#Step5Using-Punctuation-Commands-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Using Punctuation Commands"></a>Step5Using Punctuation Commands</h5><p>Microsoft Word’s text-to-speech technology does more than simply transcribing your voice. Instead, Microsoft’s voice typing technology, which originally listened only to single words, now listens to individual words and the phrase as a whole, thanks to the advent and improvement of artificial neural networks. This has allowed Microsoft to develop a long list of commands for incorporating punctuation, symbols, and other formatting options into your text without saying anything out loud except for the command word itself. To see the list of commands, press “Ctrl + Shift + S” on your keyboard to open the Stop Dictation dialogue box, then click on the Commands button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-5.jpg"                      alt="using punctuation commands"                ></p><p>We can’t go through all of the punctuation instructions here, but we’ll mention a few of the most important. For example, the command “period” inserts a period, and “comma” creates a comma, as you may guess. The same rules apply to exclamation marks and colons. In addition, you may use the command “new line” to create a new line, “new paragraph” to start a new paragraph, and “tab” to create a tab space.</p><p>If you want to insert symbols, the commands are a bit different. For example, saying “open parenthesis” will automatically insert an opening parenthesis, but you’ll need to say “close parenthesis” to get a closing parenthesis. The same goes for brackets, braces, and quotation marks.</p><p>Microsoft’s speech-to-text program is excellent. We can honestly state that Microsoft has the most refined product when it comes to cost vs performance because the software is integrated directly into Microsoft 365, which many businesses already use. So if your company uses Microsoft 365, you may start utilizing the voice typing technology right now with no additional expenses.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT-1"><a href="#Part-2-Alternatives-to-Microsoft-Word-STT-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT"></a>Part 2: Alternatives to Microsoft Word STT</h2><p>There are some great alternative options to Microsoft Word’s speech-to-text feature.
